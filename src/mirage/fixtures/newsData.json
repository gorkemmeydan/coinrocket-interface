For additional information, please see the disclaimers following the article.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nUrbit is a private, digital homestead for all-around Web3 usage; its peer-to-peer OS offers cloud and community-based services.\nIt's built from the ground up and runs on almost any phone, tablet, laptop—or anything with Unix and an internet connection.\nThe real test for Urbit is building a sustainable user community and leveraging infrastructure as a business model.\n\nInternet users often rely on third-party services to stream, store, or create content. Be it Netflix, Spotify, Youtube, or Notion, these third-party services often monetize user time or data. So why do most users continue to over-rely on third-party services? According to the founder of Signal messaging app, a potential explanation is that users 'do not want to run their own servers' because it’s technically complicated. So most users end up using what their peers also use. But there are viable solutions to this problem: Urbit is a prominent example of a protocol that allows anyone to run their own private server and interact with peers. Add to this a suite of  cloud services and seamless usage without ads, tracking, or any data capture.\n\nWhat Is Urbit? Digital Homestead\n\nImagine an extensible, open source version of WeChat: Urbit is a one-stop-shop suite of cloud and community-based services. It offers user-focused functionalities for collaboration, communication, and commerce. Urbit is designed to give users digital autonomy. It’s like decorating a digital homestead from scratch with built-in privacy: Urbit allows users to privately store their own data, digital assets, and directly communicate with peers without any third-party interference. Urbit can run on almost any phone, tablet, laptop, server—or anything with Unix and an internet connection. Urbit aims to be more personal, customizable, and durable than other existing computing platforms.\n\nSource: urbit.org\n\nCustomization is King\n\nEach Urbit service can be tailored to individual user needs; this is in contrast to the walled-garden experience of many Web2 apps: often easy to use, but less often customized to individual needs. Anyone may create tailored Urbit services based on their own vision of how Urbit should be developed. To enable custom communication and collaboration, one of the main Urbit GitHub contributors - Tlon - has created the Landscape interface, which serves as a robust toolkit for allround Web3 use. To interact with other users, Landscape enables direct chats, posting notebook entries, sharing links in reddit-style, and forming sub-communities. Project Uqbar has recently forked Landscape, offering a simple way to organize groups and an updated user interface. Other notable contributors to Urbit's kernel include: the Tirrel Corporation, an Urbit-focused payments processor; urbit.live, a marketplace for Urbit IDs; urbithost, a server hosting provider; and dcSpark, a product-focused startup building on Urbit.\n\nTechnology in a Nutshell\n\nAt its core, Urbit is a peer-to-peer computer network that runs an operating system (OS). In a nutshell, Urbit comprises two pieces of technology:\n\nPeer-to-Peer Computer Network (Urbit ID): is a distributed identity and public key infrastructure (PKI) for general-purpose authentication. An Urbit ID is like a login, network address, and Web3 wallet all in one. While Urbit IDs are instantiated as ERC-721 non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum smart contract platform, they could be secured by any other smart contract platform or even by a future Urbit Layer 1. Urbit IDs can be cryptographically owned and used as login to the Urbit network, in a similar way Blockscan and Kepler leverage 'Log-in With Ethereum'. This removes the need for login data to be provisioned by a third-party.\n\nUrbit ID enables distributed ownership of the network by its users. It’s somewhat like owning a piece of a Web3 version of TCP/IP, except that Urbit ID gives users control over their data and privacy. Based on their roles on the network, Urbit IDs are organized through a hierarchy: at the top are governance nodes (called galaxies); below galaxies are infrastructure nodes (called stars), responsible for packet routing and peer discovery. Below stars are individual nodes (called planets), that enable network access for everyday use. Any Urbit node is given full flexibility to run any version of Urbit software they choose to.\n\nOperating System (Urbit OS): is a virtual computing platform built from the ground up. It is completely sealed from the system it runs on, somewhat like Web Assembly (WASM) or the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The Urbit OS is best described as an 'overlay OS,’ in that it runs on top of other environments. Landscape offers a simple interface and community-based services that enable direct, encrypted communication between authenticated users. Every message from a source Urbit ID is encrypted and sent directly to the destination Urbit ID without any interference. Urbit allows users to flexibly deploy any version of the Urbit software to a server of choice. For users who value being in full control, Urbit can be hosted on a local machine. For users who value convenience, Urbit can be hosted via a cloud provider of choice.\n\nThe peer-to-peer network, identity system, and the virtual computing stack can be further explored here.\n\nResearch and Development Journey\n\nA niche research project aimed to re-engineer computing from first principles almost two decades ago. This research was the origin of the development of the Urbit network, which has been operational since 2013. Urbit software releases are inherently decentralized: they are determined by consensus of the core developers, primarily through planning, proposals, and discussions on the Urbit GitHub repository. The Galactic Senate, composed of Urbit's governance nodes (galaxies), may vote on any change proposal. Forks incentivize governance and infrastructure nodes to be reliable service providers for individual nodes.\n\nThe chart below indicates the most notable GitHub software releases. The pace of Urbit development has been intensifying as Urbit ID went live on Ethereum in 2019 and released the first version of Urbit OS in 2020. Urbit subsequently underwent an independent security audit and released a Bitcoin wallet in 2021. Today, Urbit is a mature system that offers stable infrastructure. Urbit engineered and recently released a Layer 2 rollup, making everyday use more affordable for anyone. Transactions are performed on Urbit, submitted to a roller, which then get processed on-chain in batches. An overview of the main software releases from Urbit inception is available <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/urbit/profile/roadmap\">here</a>.\n\nDeeper Dive: Distributed Identity\n\nThe immediate use case for Urbit ID is authentication into Urbit OS: the Urbit identity protocol is used to uniquely differentiate between Urbit OS users. Put simply, it determines that the person who is talking to you is who they say they are: by signing their messages cryptographically, users are attesting their identity. But there’s more than that: the Urbit ID system provides a set of identities as cryptographic assets.\n\nCryptographic Asset\n\nAn Urbit ID is an ERC-721 non-fungible token—a single 32-bit number—translated into a pronounceable, unique name and a visual icon (referred to as a sigil). For instance, the Urbit ID ~tinbel-picpel and the sigil below have been uniquely mapped to the number 3,500,433,403.\n\nSource: https://urbit.live/~tinbel-picpel\n\nThe combination of ~tinbel-picpel (public key) and ~winter-paches-palfun-foslup (private key) allows a user to log into Urbit OS. The ownership registry that stores the mappings between public keys and their corresponding private keys has been live on the Ethereum blockchain since 2019.\n\nFrom Urbit IDs to Network Nodes\n\nBesides being NFTs, Urbit IDs correspond to nodes on the Urbit network. One can distinguish three classes of Urbit nodes based on their role: governance nodes (galaxies), infrastructure nodes (called stars), and personal nodes (planets). In practice, personal nodes (planets) use services provided by infrastructure nodes (stars). In simplified terms, stars can be regarded as Internet Service Providers (ISPs) for planets. For example, a star might offer hosting, while another might offer add-on services like content delivery network (CDN) or Bitcoin-related nodal services. Other services include: software updates, data packet routing, and peer discovery. Conversely, governance nodes (galaxies) can be regarded as DNS root nodes that provide services to infrastructure nodes (stars).\n\nGalaxies provide services to stars, while stars provide services to planets. Additionally, galaxies form the Galactic Senate that governs the suite of smart contracts on Ethereum that secure the Urbit ID system. When it comes to software updates and releases, any galaxy can propose any vote at any time and choose to run any version of Urbit software. While there is no requirement to adhere to a particular version, simply choosing to run the latest version makes it easier for everyday usage.\n\nUrbit Tree Doesn't Grow to the Sky\n\nGiven this hierarchical division of roles on the Urbit network, the natural way to visualize galaxies, stars, and planets is using a hierarchical tree. That is, three layers stacked on top of each other: at the top layer are the governance nodes (galaxies); at the middle layer are the infrastructure nodes (stars); whereas at the bottom layer are the personal nodes (planets).\n\nThe number of Urbit IDs is bound by design: there will only ever be 2^8 galaxies. Each galaxy can distribute 2^8-1 = 255 stars. There will only ever be a maximum 2^16 stars. Each star can distribute 2^16-1 = 65,535 planets. There will only ever be a maximum 2^32 planets. Summing up, this makes a total of less than 4.3 billion galaxies, stars, and planets combined. Below is a snapshot of the hierarchical tree of Urbit nodes.\n\nToken Economics\n\nAll Urbit IDs were created simultaneously upon the initiation of the Urbit network. Some of the Urbit addresses remain locked in smart contracts that prevent any transferring of the IDs. These Urbit IDs are <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/urbit/profile/supply-schedule\">scheduled</a> to unlock linearly until 2025: urbit.org and early prize awardees unlock linearly from 2019 until 2021; early contributors, code developers, and employees unlock linearly from 2020 until 2023; private buyers unlock over one or three years based on terms of their respective contracts. Live Urbit network activity can be explored here.\n\nBy January 2024, all stars will be unlocked and available for trading. Unlocked stars are subject to spawning limits, meaning there are limits to how many planets a star can generate, which prolongs the lockup period for planets until the following year. Thus, planets will finish unlocking by January 2025.\n\nAs the scarcest of Urbit network nodes, galaxies are primarily available on over-the-counter (OTC) desks, and rarely appear for sale on open markets. Stars and planets trade regularly on various platforms such as: urbit.live, OpenSea, planet.market, urbit.me, urth systems, urbithost, urbitex.io, or Urbit Marketplace. \n\nOn one hand, planet sales transactions have been relatively steady over time: 5,255 transactions with an average price: $50 USD and one notable exception - planet ~fasmut-worner has been sold on 11/25/2021 for close to $16,000 USD. As each Urbit ID is unique, they tend to be purchased by users for their specific characteristics: names that rhyme or resemble English words are particularly appealing. Planets whose icons have circular sigils often sell for significantly more than the average price. As an example, planet ~parret-barret sold for about $1,000 USD at a time when most planets were selling for $10-20.\n\nOn the other hand, star sales have been gaining in transaction value recently - the most expensive star ~samfeb has been sold on 9/4/2021 for more than $31,000 USD. In total, there have been 1,067 transactions involving stars on urbit.live with an average price of approx. $7,300 USD per star. Wrapped stars (WSTR) trade against ETH on Uniswap as of November 2021.\n\nSource: https://urbit.live/stats\n\nA portion of Urbit IDs (15,935 items) are currently being listed on OpenSea:\n\nIs Urbit Spam-Proof?\n\nUrbit ID’s scarcity, persistent reputation and flexible design may have second-order effects in terms of incentivizing good behavior on the Urbit network.\n\nIdentity scarcity: The number of Urbit IDs is finite which engenders a natural scarcity - there will ever be just less than 4.3 billion unique Urbit IDs and each has a price tag. This means that when a user interacts with a stranger on the Urbit network, they both have skin in the game. Because Urbit IDs are scarce, the more actively used the Urbit system is, the more valuable Urbit IDs are likely to become. This may further discourage \"risk-free\" exploits of Urbit IDs.\n\nPersistent reputation: As a public key infrastructure (PKI), Urbit ID has been designed to promote Urbit's values: an identity needs to be persistent, self-sovereign, and globally consistent (uniquely identifiable). The value of permanent identity translates into accruing a persistent reputation based on the activity of each Urbit ID. Any potential adversarial behavior on the network is added to the persistent reputation. Because reputation follows each individual Urbit ID, good network behavior is inherently incentivized.\n\nFlexible design: The Urbit system is designed to account for flexibility: any galaxy, star, or planet can run any version of Urbit software they choose to. Another example is: planets can choose their stars and galaxies based on software functionalities, user communities, or any criteria that suit their needs. Planets can easily move around the Urbit network to find a new sponsor star in the Urbit tree. This design choice incentivizes galaxies and planets to be reliable service providers for planets. Conversely, stars and galaxies can essentially block planets from spamming the network or from exercising any bad behavior.\n\nThus, an important second-order implication of identity scarcity, permanent reputation, and modular design is that the Urbit system may become spam-proof: if an Urbit ID behaves as a bad actor, it damages their persistent reputation on the network. Higher value of Urbit IDs may discourage spam, bots, scams, or spreading malware: if Urbit ID NFTs become valuable enough, it would be too expensive for users trying to spam the Urbit network by creating multiple addresses or by essentially compromising the persistent reputation of individual Urbit IDs. This is in contrast to being able to cheaply create email addresses used for spamming.\n\nOpportunities: The Sky’s the Limit\n\nToday, the Urbit network is a stable, secure software that runs on most cloud servers, laptops, and mobile phones as an 'overlay OS’. Through interface implementations such as Landscape, Urbit strives to become more personal, private, and durable than any existing computing platform.\n\nUrbit Usage\n\nUrbit is a space meant for communities of users who may want to creatively customize and have control over their digital environment. Today, Urbit is primarily used by developers, and by communities of privacy enthusiasts, tinkerers, and hobbyists. But for Urbit to get a chance of living up to its aspirations, it needs to expand its user base beyond communities of tech-savvy explorers. As the Urbit network transitions from a community of early adopters to digital communities, the increasing market value of Urbit IDs may provide more resources for developers to advance code development. This, in turn, may lead to increased network utility for everyday use and may further stimulate Urbit’s expansion.\n\nSo how can Urbit increase its user adoption? According to the technology acceptance model (TAM), the two most important factors contributing to increased user adoption are: ease of use and usefulness. Let’s explore how this translates to Urbit.\n\nIn terms of ease of use, Urbit aims to lower the entry barriers for regular, non-technical users: Urbit OS can be used conveniently via a hosting service. In this sense, some stars act as hosting service providers for users who want to run their planet in the cloud, as opposed to running it locally. To ease up user life, some stars offer service bundles consisting of planet acquisition, set-up, hosting, alongside packet routing and peer discovery. Add to that a simple and intuitive user interface.\n\nIn terms of usefulness, Urbit aims to tailor its services to the needs of user communities. Urbit aims to continue iterating on the infrastructure, while, at the same time, allowing communities themselves to identify, create, and expand on useful features based on their needs.\n\nSource: urbit.org\n\nCommunity of Communities: Look to the Stars\n\nBe it posting blog entries or sharing links in reddit-style: Urbit is designed for communities to interact with each other. Planets have full flexibility over how they choose to connect with other planets. Each planet can decide how much personal information to share with whom.\n\nStars act as <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/schelling-point\">Schelling points</a> for their planets, being the natural point of spanning sub-communities of planets. Stars enable individual communities to customize their experiences, design their own software for their own usage, while being privacy-protected from the outside world. To date, 7,802 stars have been activated on the Urbit network and this number is expected to grow as communities are getting onboarded into Urbit.\n\nIn this sense, stars may represent the starting point of forming durable ties in a flourishing ecosystem: a community of communities. Within the Urbit target are communities of communities, such as Dalten Collective, point DAO, OtherLife, dcSpark, or dOrg, in need of flexible collaboration tools that can be tailored to specific community needs.\n\ndOrg is a prominent example of a developer collective that supports various Web3 projects. The dOrg community is self-managed: it consists of Web3 developers coming together to coordinate and collaborate on dApp development. This happens organically, based on common goals and affinities with developer communities such as Dxdao, Compound, DAOstack, Aragon, and Near Protocol, to name a few. dOrg is one of the first decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) that has found a working business model: as per January 2022, dOrg generates $2.5 million USD in annual revenue from bleeding-edge Web3 projects from 50 different clients. dOrg DAO consists of 60 active developers, out of which 20 are full-time.\n\nSource: dorg.tech\n\nWhile dOrg is an excellent Web3 showcase, the model of self-organizing worker communities has been validated in peer-to-peer collaboration long before the emergence of Web3. However, what was usually missing in Web2 was an underlying business model for peer-to-peer collaboration at scale. Take, for instance, the example of WikiProjects, where sub-communities of Wikipedia contributors got together to voluntarily collaborate on a topic area spanning across multiple Wikipedia articles. The common interests and the strong ties among peer contributors have been the backbone of Wikipedia’s community of communities. Ultimately, this has led to Wikipedia being at least on-par with well-established products such as Britannica. With the emergence of Web3, Urbit could become a tool that supports flourishing communities with sound business models for their collaboration and time investment to be rewarded.\n\nAssessing Urbit’s Value: Network Effects\n\nBeing able to serve emerging communities and DAOs will potentially be a key success factor for Urbit in the long-term. Upon forming a community of communities, the value of the Urbit network is set to increase with the number of Urbit communities interacting with each other. According to Reed’s law, by adding up all the possible two-person groups, three-person groups, and so on, the maximum value of the Urbit network composed of N users is 2^N. In practice, this number will depend on the number of communities each user chooses to participate in. In the context of a service like Urbit, the more connections and communities each user actively participates in, the more valuable the entire network is.\n\nLeveraging Infrastructure as Business Model\n\nUrbit does not leverage user data or time. It does not show any ads. So how can Urbit generate revenue from giving users access to the network? Urbit address space is like land that can be put to work: galaxies and stars can be regarded as network infrastructure providers to planets. Both galaxies and stars are directly incentivized to create cash flow-generating services for planets, such as: hosting, packet routing, peer discovery, task management, and payment services. One can think of these services in a similar fashion as services provided by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), Virtual Private Network Providers (VPNs), or payment/transaction processing companies. For galaxies and stars, business opportunities arise by retaining a fee as a portion of the value provided to planets.\n\nChallenges and Competition\n\nWhen attempting to realize its vision, Urbit needs to overcome several challenges and potential competition.\n\nFirst, at this early stage of adoption, Urbit is mostly used by communities of tech-savvy users. Over the long-term, Urbit may need to get broader communities onboarded. Its value proposition - decentralized personal computer with simplest possible Web3 interface - needs to convince users that it is worth switching away from the conventional computing stack.\n\nSecond, there are several paths for Urbit to leverage infrastructure as a business model. Finding the right incentives for infrastructure providers to offer value-added services is going to be key to onboarding flourishing communities. One potential path forward could be offering consumer services such as music and video streaming to gauge broader community interests.\n\nThird, since Urbit is an inherently complex technology, its development incurs execution risk. Some skeptics may find that Urbit resembles more to an obscure art project, rather to a new technology. It is essential for Urbit to be able to steadily deliver value-added services; while, at the same time, not compromise on Urbit’s core values.\n\nFinally, while Urbit is a unique project, one should not rule out direct and non-direct competition. To begin with, SpruceID, Kepler, and Blockscan are prominent examples of self-sovereign identity and data services that leverage “Log-in With Ethereum''. In this sense, one could further think of personal server services offered by any emerging Layer 1s and Layer 2s that do not compromise on scalability and privacy. Existing solutions such as Project Galaxy and Bisq could potentially turn into competitors to Urbit OS, provided that they increase the ease of use and a one-stop-shop for various functionalities. Other potential competitors for Urbit ID may include Microsoft’s ION and 1KOSMOS to name a few. When aggregating all the services Urbit intends to provide, conglomerates such as WeChat, KakaoTalk or any similar services could presumably be counted as Urbit competitors, provided they may follow a path towards progressive decentralization in the long-run.\n\nConclusion\n\nUrbit’s ambitions are wide-ranging, with the potential to have meaningful implications for the future of peer-to-peer Web3 infrastructure and community-based services. With Urbit OS being stable, now is the right time to onboard larger communities onto the Urbit network. While being an unarguably unique and solid project, there are challenges under way. The real test for Urbit’s long term viability is building a sustainable community of communities and leveraging infrastructure as a business model. Being able to quickly pivot and adopt the most suitable business strategy will be key for Urbit to thrive. It all comes down to executing flawlessly and gaining wide-scale community adoption.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Urbit, a member of Messari Hub.

A trend like this hints at the possibility that this is a consolidation phase. The gaming sector was the hardest hit this week, posting a 10.47% loss—this week’s only double-digit negative return. DeFi also had a rough week, finishing second to last with a -8.61% return. The sector with the least decline was top assets, returning -2.69%.\n\nTop Assets\n\nTerra (LUNA) has not ceased to impress as the alternate Layer-1 platform has continued outperforming amidst a global conflict. It is the third week in a row that LUNA has secured double-digit positive returns, prompting investors to wonder how sustainable this rally is. However, LUNA is at a critical point, now that it has briefly reached all-time-high territory. It remains to be seen whether this will mark a double top (and potential freefall) or if the $100 price line will become support for new price discovery. LUNA finished the week with a 15.4% gain while Ripple (XRP) was the only other asset within the top ten assets by market capitalization that ended the week in the green (1.7%).\n\nDeFi Assets\n\nNo DeFi top assets made it above water this week. One of last week’s top two performers, Anchor (ANC) saw its price reach an all-time-high of $6.19 during the first half of the week in anticipation of the upcoming Arca and Polychain anchor proposals and potential future tokenomic changes. ANC saw heavy upwards price action earlier week followed by abating price towards the end of the week, marking the money market protocol asset’s largest recorded decline. The magnitude of the loss was enough to shift it from the top spot down to last, finishing the week with a -18.2% return. True DeFi TVL (no double count TVL of certain protocols) is sitting at a stable $158.9 billion.\n\nSmart Contract Platforms\n\nFor the third week in a row, Terra (LUNA) has led the smart contract platform sector by a wide margin. Although this week was no different, it seems as if its momentum might be slowing down for the moment after posting a more conservative (compared to previous weeks) return of 15.4%. The Cosmos-based IBC chain’s recent rally is a testament to how deeply tied its performance is to the issuance of new UST, which recently reached its peak issuance limits driven by a massive demand for decentralized stablecoins. Only two other smart contract platform assets finished the week in the green: NEAR Protocol (NEAR) and Tron (TRX) with 4.9% and 1.2%, respectively.\n\nCurrencies\n\nPrivacy coins have had notable performances lately, mainly driven by the events surrounding the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the recent executive order signed by President Joe Biden on cryptocurrencies. Although both Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) found themselves in double-digit territory towards the end of the week, only ZEC was able to maintain its momentum. ZEC secured a 12.6% gain while XMR took the third spot with a 2.2% return.\n\nWeb3\n\nWhile Stacks (STX) has not been demonstrating much positive price performance, a green candle yesterday saw its price wick up to 72% following news that Okcoin pledged $165 million to support Bitcoin-related projects. While STX finished the week with a 26.6% gain, Arweave (AR) was the only other asset within the top Web3 assets that ended the week with a positive return (3.9%).\n\nGaming\n\nAavegotchi (GHST) was the only top gaming asset that closed the week with a positive return, bringing in 0.1%. The low figure was expected due to the asset’s comparatively low volatility. Losses for the other top gaming assets by market capitalization ranged from -6.2% to -14.8% corresponding to Enjin (ENJ) and Alice (ALICE), respectively.\n\n",

      "title": "Injective: An Interoperable Exchange Infrastructure Protocol for DeFi Markets",
      "content": "The following report was commissioned by Injective, a member of <a href=\"https://messari.io/hub\">Messari Hub</a>. For additional information, please see the disclaimers following the article.\n\nLast year, the crypto industry witnessed the broad expansion of decentralized markets. Teams entered the fray each with their own vision for DEX services of differentiated exchange infrastructures, covered markets and products, and UX priorities. And even those which looked similar on the surface diverged in remote design choices such as liquidity management, order clearing mechanism, and governance implementation.\n\nInjective is a notable example with the launch of its mainnet back in November 2021. The Injective protocol provides the underlying fully decentralized orderbook exchange infrastructure for accessing cross-chain spot and derivative markets with zero gas fees, thanks to its unique technical architecture.\n\nMore specifically, this is an application-specific blockchain built with Cosmos SDK and designed to function as an interoperable decentralized exchange infrastructure layer. The architecture differs from other popular DEXs operating on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or other Layer-1s since the protocol provides trading services on its own execution layer and allows third party exchanges to permissionlessly build on Injective. The choice aligns with their vision of robust decentralization and high capital efficiency through a shared orderbook. The short block time and instant finality granted by the underlying Tendermint core allow the protocol to handle high transaction demand while keeping the chain secure and trustless.\n\n\t\t\t\n\nA Thorough Trading Experience\t\t\t\n\nPrior to the launch of the mainnet, Injective underwent robust experimentation with a diverse set of products before making the transition. Apart from the eleven perpetual and spot markets currently online, the chain had also hosted markets for legacy assets such as synthetic stocks, oil, gas, gold, and forex futures on its Solstice testnet. Pending further governance, the community is willing to resurrect some of these markets in 2022 and introduce complementary products run on the orderbook model of liquidity.\t\t\t\n\nOptions, synthetics, betting dApps, or any other instrument that can leverage Injective’s matching mechanism can be built on top of the chain. Since the chain aspires to become a complete toolbox for decentralized financial markets, many other seemingly peripheral financial products like lending services and trading guilds can also be incorporated to enhance protocol services.\t\t\n\nAlong with their vision of robust decentralization, permissionless market creation becomes a rudimentary design choice for its operations. That’s why on the Injective Chain, community members can build novel financial products, kick-start pools for existing products, and start trading completely new markets without the supervision of a central authority. New market proposals do require governance approval for listing – yet, the protocol also allows users to circumvent that option by paying a listing fee, which recently dropped to 100 INJ (the native token) from 1000 INJ, making the process faster and more independent.\t\t\n\nThe permissionless state of market creation and concerns over protocol solvency drove Injective to adopt an isolated risk coverage model. Since Injective doesn’t want risk in one market to spill over to other markets, it requires each new pair to establish an insurance fund before trading is allowed to commence. Each pair is backed by these separate backstop pools ready to compensate for any deficit caused by market volatility. After underwriters set up the fund, users are able to contribute to the pool with their collateral tokens and benefit from the liquidation proceeds.\t\t\n\nTo prevent frontrunning and enhance the user experience, the protocol uses Frequent Batch Auctions (FBA) as its order clearing mechanism. In FBA, orders submitted to the mempool are executed at the end of each block (~1 second block time) and are not published on the order book until the auction process is complete. Veiling the information by implementing a delay time is how Injective aims to enhance the trading experience for traders and allow market makers to provide deeper liquidity at tighter spreads without needing to worry about high-frequency traders disrupting the market-making activities.\t\t\n\nKnowing that liquidity and attention are among the most valuable resources in crypto, Injective’s mainnet launched with an incentive program called Astro designed to increase liquidity on order books and attract traders to the platform. The protocol is distributing 10 million INJ tokens ($120 million at the time of launch), from which 70% is allocated to users as trading rewards and 30% to liquidity providers under the Dedicated Market Maker (DMM) Program. The reward program is an ongoing activity, and the protocol is explicitly focusing on recruiting more market makers this year with the goal of establishing healthier order book depth for traders.\n\nSource: Injective Exchange\n\nIt’s been only four months since the protocol launched its Canonical Chain mainnet. However, its first months have been compelling. In four months, the cumulative volume on the exchange passed $4.5 billion, where most of the volume came from derivative markets. The chain TVL peaked at $130 million, but the recent market trend took its toll on the protocol just like other DeFi platforms, driving the TVL down to $42 million. As of March 7, the protocol sits at $120 million.\n\n\t\t\t\n\nGasless Trading\t\t\n\nThanks to its technical design choices, the chain operates similarly to an engine. It delivers the core functionality but requires complementary parts in order to become accessible to the end-user. Currently, exchange applications built on the Injective Chain handle transactions by playing the role of information bridges between users and chain nodes.\t\t\n\nAlthough the Injective Chain is built with Cosmos SDK, it uses custom Ethereum accounts with app-generated wallets and a bespoke implementation to parse EIP-712-typed data. Users submit their interaction requests by sending cryptographically signed messages to exchange DApps (relayers). Then these messages, a.k.a meta-transactions, are broadcast by the exchange DApp to a full Injective Chain node, where they get unwrapped and added into the mempool. The node checks the transaction and includes it in a block while ordering transaction execution according to their categorical importance — liquidation and order cancel requests are prioritized.\n\nThe unique transaction handling of the Injective Chain strongly favors the end-user as accessing the chain through an exchange DApp alleviates the burden of gas fees. Since exchanges broadcast signed messages to Injective Chain nodes, not the traders, all the fees related to chain interactions are covered by the exchange DApp, resulting in zero gas fees for traders. This allows users to trade on the exchange without having INJ in their accounts. Removing the hurdle of acquiring the chain’s native token is a significant enhancement of the UX. Injective doubles down on this feature by allocating a rebate pool of $100,000 to cover gas costs when users bridge funds from Ethereum for the first time.\t\n\nDecentralization on all fronts is a top priority for the Injective community. That’s why the consensus mechanism, backend infrastructure, governance, and the exchange DAppsare designed to disburse centralized points of failure. Although most of the protocols aim to decentralize their frontend, users are most familiar with the decentralization of the backend and governance. They don’t use alternative access points to interact with the protocol, which practically centralizes the front-end.\t\t\n\nAs a Layer-1 for DeFi markets, Injective allows customizable exchange DApps to be built on top of the protocol and incentivizes the creation of multiple gateways for users. Exchanges are rewarded with 40% of trading fees collected through their front-end in return for handling transactions. Injective ecosystem welcomes new operators to handle this intermediary mining role with a reasonably costless hardware requirement.\n\nCurrently, there are six exchanges built on top of the Injective Chain: Picasso Exchange, MarsX, Unlimited Exchange, Lunatics Exchange, Inj Dojo Exchange, and Injective Pro which is provided by the core team.\t\t\n\nAll these exchanges are connected to the same markets via a shared orderbook but differ in how they provide access. For instance, in contrast to the Injective Pro relayer, Picasso exchange offers a swap mechanism for the spot markets with a UI akin to AMM DEXs. And MarsX chooses to give access to two of the perp markets, whereas other exchanges show all four. Exchanges built on Injective aren’t identical frontend access points but carry specialized value offerings, resulting in improved user experience, tailored products for different geographies, and increased decentralization.\t\t\n\nExchange DApps are necessary agents for daily users, but they are not indispensable. A trader can always opt to interact with the chain through API rather than an exchange frontend. In fact, providing a smooth API service to traders is as essential to the protocol as offering exchange DApps. It is the most convenient way for big players to interact with the chain as it’s built to onboard market makers and foster institutional adoption. An increase in API trading activity practically enhances decentralization as users operate as independent broadcasters. By using API, traders need to cover a minimal amount for gas fees as they don’t use a separate exchange service to broadcast their transactions. However, they only pay 60% of the trading fees in return. Considering the low gas costs on the chain, the 40% exchange discount on trading fees makes API trading a more financially lucrative choice for high-volume traders.\n\n\t\t\t\n\nInjective’s Core Interoperability\t\t\n\nAs the protocol aims to rule the liquidity on multiple chains, find them, bring them, and bind them in one chain through various products that can benefit from order book trading, the chain allows traders to communicate with other IBC-enabled chains through its IBC integration and the Ethereum mainnet through the cross-chain Injective Bridge.\t\t\n\nThis connectedness allows the platform to amass liquidity through seamless bidirectional token transfers and support cross-chain trading of the tokens originated from separate ecosystems. The chain already allows transfers between the Terra, Cosmos Hub, and Ethereum networks – and with the introduction of EVM-compatibility expected this year, Injective is shooting for further developer acquisition and a populated ecosystem built on top of the execution layer.\n\n\t\t\n\nINJ tokenomics\t\t\t\n\nThe native token INJ was initially released as an ERC-20 token and then migrated over to its own chain. INJ is a multipurpose token, functioning like a bolt (or gear) positioned in the most critical areas of a complex engine:\t\t\t\n\nThe security of the chain depends on INJ: As Injective’s Tendermint consensus is based on delegated proof-of-stake, block producers need to stake INJ in order to validate blocks and get rewarded with INJ for their contribution. Currently, the minimum amount required to be a validator is 1 INJ. \t\t\t\nGovernance of the exchange also means governance of the chain: INJ holders vote on exchange improvements, parameter alterations, and new feature implementations, as well as chain updates and inflationary reward mechanisms. As it is crucial for the chain to maintain its security and governance efficiency, Injective Protocol incentivizes staking by offering trading fee discounts. With the Injective VIP program, INJ stakers enjoy a trading fee discount proportional to the amount staked. \t\t\t\nIt’s used for trading fee auctioning: After distributing 40% of the trading fees to exchange DApps, Injective conducts a buyback with the remaining 60%. The protocol conducts weekly auctions where participants bid on the fees of that week with INJ. The auction winner gets a basket of tokens and profits from the arbitrage opportunity, while protocol uses the proceeds to buy and burn INJ. \t\t\t\n\nThe maximum supply for INJ was initially set to 100 million. However, since the block rewards are compensated by minting new tokens, there is inflationary pressure on this number, turning it into a soft cap and an anchor value for the desired supply.\n\nIn theory, the total INJ supply can exceed the anchor value. The weekly supply burns create a deflationary effect and offset the supply increase caused by token minting to a certain extent. To be more precise, 5% yearly inflation on 13 million staked INJ equals 650,000 INJ minting in a year while the total burning in the eight weeks alone was 204,000, netting out to approximately 1,326,000  INJ burned a year, accounting for 1.325% of total supply.\n\nMoving Forward\t\t\n\nWith solid execution, Injective can further its reach behind the tailwinds of the Injective community, increased adoption of the Cosmos ecosystem, and continued growth of decentralized exchanges. Facilitating the introduction of novel products such as insurance dApps and trading guilds can enhance the user experience, increase the value accrual to the token, and make Injective a more comprehensive toolbox for decentralized markets.\t\t\t\n\nOne can argue that being an application-specific blockchain might prevent a DeFi platform from accessing the concentrated liquidity of a highly populated Layer 1 and the native toolbox coming with it. With its bridges to Ethereum and IBC-enabled chains and soon-to-be-implemented EVM compatibility, Injective Protocol possesses the necessary fundamentals to avoid these kinds of hindrances. Should Injective become a hotspot for decentralized chain development, there is a chance the protocol becomes the accepted infrastructure for cross-chain trading services and power tomorrow’s decentralized markets.\n\n  \n  \n  \nThis report was commissioned by Injective, a member of Messari Hub.

Preliminary discussions are ongoing.\n\nSector Returns\n\nThe markets have seen a solid rebound across all sectors despite the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. On February 22nd Bitcoin seemingly uncoupled from the S&P 500, hinting at the possibility that the Russia–Ukraine conflict has driven demand for the digital gold alternative and subsequently prompted an industry-wide rally. Five of the six sectors covered returned double-digit gains for the week. DeFi had an impressive turnaround after being the worst performer of last week, bringing in a return of 14%. However it still hasn't completely erased last week's losses. Gaming performed the least, returning 8.94% on the week.\n\nTop Assets\n\nTerra (LUNA) continues its massive run as it secured a 40% gain on the week. The Cosmos based IBC chain has been on an upwards trend for the past two weeks as the Cosmos ecosystem has seen positive crowd sentiment for the past weeks. The next best-performing asset of the sector was Polkadot (DOT) with a conservative 13.0% return compared to LUNA. The rest of the assets traded fairly close to each other, ending the week trading within a 7.9% range. Avalanche lagged behind the group with a 5.1% return.\n\nDeFi Assets\n\nDeFi had two clear outperformers this week, THORChain (RUNE) and Anchor Protocol (ANC). THORChain (RUNE) led the pack with a substantial 55.4% gain while its Cosmos- based companion, Anchor Protocol (ANC), brought in an equally impressive 39.3% gain. The catalyst behind RUNE’s rally could be tied to the cross-chain liquidity project’s upcoming mainnet launch and integration with Terra. Similar to the top assets sector, the rest of the assets traded in synchrony and ended the week trading within an 8.1% range. PancakeSwap took the last spot with a 4.7% return.\n\nSmart Contract Platforms\n\nEvidently, Cosmos- based projects have been outperforming, validating the anticipated Cosmos season driven by trending interest in interoperability. Terra (LUNA) led the smart contract platforms sector with a continued rally, finishing the week with a 40% return. Following closely was Cosmos (ATOM) itself, securing 36.8% for the week. The third asset with 30%+ gains was Near (NEAR) which brought in 32.9% driven by news surrounding its recently announced partnership with Multichain (previously named AnySwap). TRONTron (TRX) was the only top ten asset within the sector that ended in the red (-1.5%).\n\nCurrencies\n\nPrivacy coins were the best performers of the currencies sector this week. Zcash (ZEC) led the pack with a 26.3% return while its closest competitor Monero (XMR) took the second spot (16.9%). Bitcoin secured the third position on the list returning 11.1% on the week. The digital gold narrative seems to continue gaining traction as investors increasingly consider Bbitcoin as a safe haven asset.\n\nWeb3\n\nAll top ten Web3 assets ended the week in positive territory with Render (RNDR) as the top performer. The distributed rendering protocol asset went as high as having a 40% gain this week but gave half of it back and ended with a 20.4% return. Helium (HNT) secured the last position of the sector with a 2.1% return.\n\nGaming\n\nThe gaming sector assets showed low correlation in their trading as few followed an easily identifiable trend. By the first half of the week, half of the assets were in negative territory but were able to regain momentum, leaving only Aavegotchi (GHST) to end the week in the red (-0.8%). Ultra (UOS) brought in the highest return (19.6%) of the week.\n\n",

      "title": "Crossing the Threshold of Decentralized M&A",
      "content": "As the product of the first decentralized application merger, Threshold (f.k.a. Keep Network / NuCypher) looks to create the de facto encryption network for blockchain and crypto, leading with a refurbished and highly scalable decentralized solution (tBTC v2) to bring BTC to the Ethereum network. Thanks in part to Keep’s previous iteration of tBTC and NuCypher’s expansive node network, Threshold aims to offer the first fully decentralized Bitcoin-to-Ethereum asset bridge, a space that is controlled by centralized custodial provider BitGo with help from some notable partners. While not easy, Threshold looks to leverage the merger as a means to overcome the seemingly impossible task.\n\nBackground\n\nKeep Network\n\nKeep Network was founded in 2017 by Matt Luongo and Corbin Pon as a privacy layer for public blockchains. KEEP utilized off-chain data containers that were able to interact with smart contracts. These off-chain data containers referred to as “Keeps” are managed by a distributed network of Keep operators, called “Signers”, who are randomly assigned portions of user data further protecting the information from unwanted access. By fragmenting and encrypting the data across multiple signers, access to the complete information would require multiple parties to collude and agree to combine their segments, which would seemingly run counter to their own interests. This system relies on Keep Network’s primary application, secure multi-party computation (sMPC), which ensures an individual signer cannot decode the information stored on the network. While Keep Network is at its core an encryption network, the most popular use case of the network is tBTC, Keep’s Bitcoin-to-Ethereum asset bridge.\n\nNuCypher:\n\nNuCypher was founded in 2015 by Michael Egorov and MacLane Wilkison with the goal of providing data protection and encryption that still allows users to move information and computation to the cloud securely. NuCypher’s core technology is known as Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE), which allows for end-to-end data encryption where a proxy entity transforms encrypted data from key to key (“re-encrypting”) without ever needing to decrypt the source data. PRE ensures data owners have the ability to grant and revoke access to private data. In 2017, NuCypher evolved the company into a blockchain-based operation integrating smart contract technology, threshold cryptography,  and a token-based decentralized infrastructure model to establish PRE as a decentralized protocol. Today NuCypher’s PRE technology focuses on providing cryptographic access controls to distributed apps and protocols rather than traditional data-sensitive industries like healthcare and traditional finance.\n\nMerger:\n\nM&A Landscape:\n\nIn traditional finance, mergers and acquisitions make up the backbone of some of the largest banks and financial institutions' bottom line, and serve as a catalyst for the exuberant bonus schemes sought by wall street investment bankers. According to Reuters, 2021 was a record-breaking year for M&A with 62,193 deals exchanging more than $5.8 trillion in value, up 64% from 2020 and topping the previous record of $4.55 trillion set back in 2007. The profitability of M&A deals coupled with the ever-growing number of blockchain-based projects today, it should come as no surprise that deal flow is expected to play a big role in crypto as winners gain share and resources are found to be more effective together than as competitors. But with an untraditional ownership model driven by the community rather than a board of directors, how does the M&A landscape look in the land of crypto?\n\nAs with much of crypto, the definition of a merger varies from announcement to announcement and often doesn’t look the same as Google buying a private startup for their tech or Sprint and T-Mobile combining together in hopes of taking share from AT&T and Verizon. Crypto M&A can come in many different flavors, and 2021 saw the space take its first steps into the world of M&A. Alameda Research’s acquisition of RenVM’s technology team was essentially a team-wide hiring spree bringing the Ren team into the Alameda fold and prioritizing the team's focus on interoperability across the Solana ecosystem. Yearn.finance had multiple “mergers” announced this year which were better described as platform integrations rather than an outright combination or purchase of one another. On the acquisition front, Polygon has been active with their checkbook acquiring Hermez Network and Mir for $250M and $400M respectively.\n\nWhen it comes to a true decentralized M&A, the club becomes even smaller. Recently Fei Protocol and Rari Capital agreed to consolidate their platforms in an effort to corner the liquidity provisioning space. Rari’s RGT token will be exchangeable for TRIBE at a rate of 10:267 with Fei Protocol assuming all of Rari’s liabilities associated with the $10M exploit of the platform back in May 2021. From a governance viewpoint, TRIBE and RGT holders were seemingly largely in favor of the merger with the proposal garnering a 90% YES vote from the Fei Protocol community and a 93% YES from Rari members. Now as the Rari and Fei communities move forward with their merger from a product and governance perspective, let’s dig into one of the earliest mergers in this space consisting of NuCypher and KEEP - enter Threshold.\n\nThreshold:\n\nOriginally announced back in March 2021 under the code name KEANU (Keep And NuCypher), the merger of the two encryption platforms became the first merger of two decentralized protocols. The Threshold merger takes place at the code level of the respective protocols, referred to as a “hard merge” where both Keep and NuCypher as independent protocols cease to exist and the successor protocol, Threshold, goes on providing all the services that Keep/NuCypher previously provided, and looks to extend its services to become the platform for any form of threshold cryptography.\n\nCombining code is one thing, but combining two large groups of stakeholders is another feat entirely. While the initial merger proposal was released in March 2021  the deal wasn’t finalized until June 11th when both Keep and NuCypher communities voted YES (78% KEEP / 100% NU) on RC0 Token Proposal. While the passed agreement is neatly titled RC0, the proposal actually went through 6 different iterations where members from both communities went back and forth on everything from names, exchange rates for predecessor tokens, and governance structures. Finally, the two communities came to an agreement on T6 Token Proposal which consisted of both parties gaining an equivalent share of the new Threshold network as well as the establishment of an independent Threshold DAO treasury. The biggest challenges that T6 Token Proposal set out to accomplish was (1) no token left behind, (2) minimizing the risk of “zombie” KEEP/NU tokens, and (3) establishing a strong risk management system for the successor DAO.\n\nAs part of RC0, the conversion rates for KEEP and NU tokens were set at 1:4.78 and 1:3.26 respectively. The rates were based on each tokens’ total supply after both protocols halted inflation, and resulted in each protocol representing 45% of the Threshold network. The initial supply for T was set at 10B with 10% reserved for the Threshold DAO. Now with the conversion rates and token name finalized, the real work could begin - determining DAO governance.\n\nGovernance:\n\nInspired by the success of Compound Finance, the Threshold team decided to model their post-merger governance structure according to the lending protocol’s Governor Bravo. The decision was made to establish a three-pronged system which included a bicameral DAO, representing the token holders (Token Holder DAO)  and network stakers (Staker DAO), as well as an elected multisig council.\n\nThe bulk of governance control is given to the Staker DAO, however, each branch operates within a range of checks and balances. The two components of Governor Bravo, Token Holder DAO and Staker DAO, each have the ability to propose on-chain votes, delegate votes, and execute proposals. Token Holder DAO consists of T token holders, stakers, and those who have deposited their tokens into a coverage pool (a component of tBTC). On the other hand, Staker DAO consists of stakers with their voting power determined by their relative share of staked T tokens. As mentioned before, the majority of protocol governance lies with the Staker DAO, which makes sense as this group is focused on supporting the protocol network and its various services. Token Holder DAO on other hand is responsible for the more “capital markets” needs of the organization, including managing and deploying the DAO treasury and minting additional T tokens in order to limit any inflation risks.\n\nFinally, the Multisig Council consists of 9 elected representatives, with 4 seats selected by NU token holders and 4 seats by KEEP token holders. The remaining seat is voted on by the combined communities. Each member is expected to hold their position for a year and actively contribute to the development of Threshold. There is currently no term limit on council members, yet seats can be revoked by a Token Holder DAO vote. The council’s governance power is focused on proposals with protocol-wide impact including staking rewards management and veto power, which is to be used as a failsafe for any detrimental proposals that are passed.\n\nMerger Benefits:\n\nThreshold brings together the strengths of both Keep and NuCypher, and avoids two of their biggest roadblocks. For Keep, the merger adds scale for the off-chain data storage network by increasing the number of network nodes from ~200 to over ~2,000. This increase in validators creates a more decentralized signer set which reduces the risk of collusion. NuCypher’s PRE on the other hand inherits an existing Keep-built application with usage in need of scalable security. Keep’s primary use case today has been their Bitcoin-to-Ethereum asset bridge (tBTC) which utilized their off-chain storage network to hold Bitcoin in a decentralized encrypted state, while the synthetic tBTC can be deployed on the Ethereum network. As part of the merger roadmap, Threshold plans to upgrade to tBTC v2 which brings all the original benefits of tBTC on a scalable network with lower costs and higher security.\n\ntBTC and the Need for Bitcoin on Ethereum:\n\nBitcoin is the original DLT, the big bang of what we all today know as crypto. The problem (positive to some) with Bitcoin is that for the next generation of money, it’s not particularly “smart”, however, it is very secure. While PoW receives very mixed reviews depending on who you ask, the amount and cost of the “work” involved in Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism create an extremely secure digital currency with minimal risk of corruption. The Bitcoin Mining industry is a multi-billion dollar publicly traded sector and BTC itself represents ~40% of the total crypto market. While BTC was many people’s first investment in crypto, most eventually go deeper down the rabbit hole and transition to smart contracts where DeFi, NFTs, P2E, and all the other Web 3.0 acronyms reside. Security is traded for innovation, but while the crypto ecosystem has built decentralized bridges and side chains for every layer 1 today, there still has not been a truly decentralized connection between Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto world.\n\nERC-20 Bitcoin does exist, Wrapped BTC is one of the more popular implementations in DeFi, but wBTC along with 9 of the other top 10 solutions, are either centralized or operated through a hybrid model, which essentially is decentralization with a kill switch. The table below highlights just how centralized Bitcoin is on Ethereum with wBTC representing almost 4x the next nine platforms combined. Even more surprising than wBTC dominance, is the minimal amount of BTC actually deployed on Ethereum and other smart contract blockchains today. The total BTC held by the top ten solutions represents less than 2% of the total BTC in circulation today. This begs the question, do BTC holders not trust centralized systems or do they simply not want anything to do with the rest of crypto? Threshold is betting on the former.  The merger of Keep and NuCypher makes tBTC v2 a viable competitor in the Bitcoin-to-Ethereum solution space offering a low-cost, permissionless, and decentralized alternative to wBTC and the other top ERC-20 implementations. The question remains, does the demand for a more decentralized BTC-to-Ethereum asset bridge even exists?\n\nConclusion/Roadmap:\n\nLooking ahead, the Threshold team remains focused on launching tBTC v2 and taking a greater slice of the Bitcoin-to-Ethereum asset bridge pie with a current goal of $7B TVL by the end of 2022 - which would place tBTC comfortably behind wBTC as the second largest Bitcoin derivative on Ethereum.  While DeFi is built on the concept of active assets the majority of Bitcoin holders seem comfortable with their current positions.  The institutional investors increasingly becoming interested in crypto are all starting with Bitcoin, so perhaps this new cohort of investors are more inclined to deploy their Bitcoin on Ethereum or some other blockchain, but will they want to use a decentralized medium?\n\nThreshold believes the demand is imminent in the next crypto cycle with the team envisioning their bridge architecture as the preferred method of bringing BTC to Ethereum.  Additionally, the Threshold DAO is developing a stablecoin (thUSD) to complement tBTC with a compatible risk-off asset collateralized by tBTC. The team believes that thUSD could eventually support decentralized lending for real assets, such as a mortgage or car loans. Overall, the two communities seem to have come together smoothly and are now focused on making sure all the work of a decentralized merger actually pays off.  While many in crypto may not have used either platform directly in the past, this fact is likely to change as Threshold looks to take share in the new year.",

      "title": "Tranche Finance: One Risk Doesn't Rule Them All",
      "content": "The following report was commissioned by Tranche Finance, a member of <a href=\"https://messari.io/hub\">Messari Hub</a>. For additional information, please see the disclaimers following the article.\n\nThe crypto community has a love for two things: Lamborghinis and McDonalds. Sure, part of that is for meme value, but – just as with lies – behind every meme lies a hint of truth. It’s well-known crypto markets are volatile and that volatility leads to greed and fear. Of course, in a mature market, people don’t have to go to bed with alerts turned on in case markets crash in the middle of the night. Thankfully, signs point to crypto maturing before our eyes. New products exist to serve the needs of investors and guarantee peace of mind. Take Tranche Finance, a yield-fixing risk-management protocol, as an example.\n\nThe Origins of Tranche\n\nThe origins of Tranche Finance date back to the last bull market. Before Tranche Finance existed, there was Jibrel, a crypto startup started by the same co-founders. Jibrel launched as a company dedicated to real-world asset tokenization under a regulated umbrella. Project development was wholly funded by the Jibrel Network Token (JNT) – but as Jibrel’s business model began to creep more and more on-chain over time, the team realized building applications on the blockchain would have a much greater impact on the crypto ecosystem. Thus, the transition from Jibrel to Tranche Finance started in 2021 when the SLICE token replaced the JNT token. During this process, existing JNT tokenholders were airdropped with new SLICE tokens at a 10:1 ratio and the latter became the native token for the new protocol.\n\nA Win-Win Proposition\n\nSo why did the co-founders pivot and what opportunity did they see? Tranche Finance became a protocol designed to restructure the interest rate on yield accruing tokens for those interested in taking on more – or less – risk. Yield accrual tokens are one of the most important building blocks in DeFi. On a functional level, these are what lenders get back when they lend out tokens in the ecosystem: Take DAI for example in Compound, lenders deposit the stablecoin with the lending platform and receive cDAI in return. The cDAI collects interest at some variable yield for the investor. Unfortunately, yields can be volatile, a feature attractive to degens but not for institutional investors.\n\nTranche Finance splits yield accrual tokens into two tranches, each with their own  level of riskiness. The less risky tranche (Tranche A) allows holders to receive a fixed rate whereas the riskiest tranche (Tranche B) pays holders a variable rate higher than Tranche A, but is liable to cover losses first when loan defaults occur.\n\nRisk-tranching is a win-win mechanism: Risk-averse investors have the chance to avoid volatile interest rate fluctuations and be certain of their returns. On the other hand, risk-seeking investors can increase their returns by betting on the zero-loss scenario in which borrowers do not default.\n\nDeep in the Trenches\n\nTo understand how tranches work, let’s use an example. Alice and Bob lend out 100 DAI and 10 DAI respectively on Compound and subsequently receive cDAI, a token earning a 3% variable yield. Alice is worried about her borrowers’ ability to pay back the loan whereas Bob is confident and would like to give his return a boost. They both go to Tranche Finance and deposit their cDAI. Alice mints a Tranche A token that yields a fixed rate equal to 2 % whereas Bob mints a Tranche B token that yields a variable rate of 13 %.\n\nIf borrowers pay back their loans, Alice earns 2 DAI (100 DAI x 2%) and Bob earns 0.3 DAI (10 DAI x 3%) from his cDAI plus whatever Alice didn’t earn from hers, namely 1 DAI (100 DAI x 3%-2 DAI). The total DAI Bob takes home is then 1.3 for a 13% return.\n\nIf any default occurs, Alice earns 2 DAI anyway whereas Bob earns 1.3 DAI minus interest due from borrowers who didn’t fulfill their obligations.\n\nIs it Solvent, SIR?\n\nThe calculations shown above highlight the role of a key factor in the tranching remuneration: The share of Tranche B holders relative to Tranche A holders.\n\nThe lower the ratio between Tranche B deposits and Tranche A deposits, the higher the Tranche B remuneration and vice versa.\n\nThis mechanism originates from Tranche B holders earning what Tranche A holders give up in exchange for fixing the latter’s rate. When there’s fear in the market, investors can choose to hedge against negative fluctuations by minting Tranche A. Tranche B holders will then earn a sizable return for taking the same risks most investors want to protect from. On the other hand, when markets are euphoric, investors are more likely to increase their exposure to risk and choose Tranche B. Compared to the previous case, Tranche B returns will be lower because the pie left on the table by Tranche A holders will be split among a higher number of investors.\n\nHowever, it’s possible two extreme situations can occur:\n\n1. Tranche B TVL approaches Tranche A TVL: In this situation, Tranche B returns decrease asymptotically towards the underlying protocol return (e.g. the return offered on cDAI by Compound). To avoid this scenario, SLICE rewards are distributed to Tranche A holders in order to restore any imbalance.\n\n2. Tranche A return exceeds underlying protocol return: This scenario could happen if a sharp decrease in the borrowing volume occurs in the underlying protocol. In that case, the relationship between Tranche B returns and Tranche A returns becomes inverted: The higher the Tranche A TVL, the lower the Tranche B return. Indeed, Tranche B holders are forced to pay the Tranche A fixed-rate out of their own pockets. Shifting SLICE rewards entirely to Tranche B holders helps restore the returns’ trajectory towards zero.\n\nThe solution is to distribute SLICE rewards between Tranche B and Tranche A returns and prevent the extreme scenarios illustrated above from occurring.\n\nGiven a certain number of daily SLICE rewards allocated to each market, the proportion of rewards allocated to the senior tranche is defined as the Solvency Incentive Ratio (SIR). The SIR can be expressed as follows:\n\nUnlike solvency ratios in traditional banking, it’s not necessarily true that a higher SIR is always better. When Tranche A returns trail the underlying protocol returns, a higher SIR will increase Tranche A TVL and, therefore, the Tranche B returns will grow as well. However, when Tranche A returns exceed underlying protocol returns, a lower SIR will increase SLICE rewards for Tranche B holders, increasing Tranche B TVL and, therefore, their returns.\n\nTVL variations do not have a linear trend. A higher SIR will increase Tranche A TVL up to a certain point where fixed yields will be much less attractive than variable yields. The same applies for Tranche B TVL as SIR gets lower. This tendency of moving towards an asymptote can be tweaked by a “balance factor” used to establish an equilibrium between the two Tranche TVL. Without the balance factor, it would be much easier for one of the two extreme scenarios to occur.\n\nThe Everlasting Tranches\n\nWhen setting a risk management strategy, the duration of risk exposure is one of the most important aspects to factor in. What would make tranches maximally flexible in terms of duration? Simple: Infinite duration. Tranche Finance provides epoch-less tranche tokens. The advantages to using a perpetual tranche consist of the following:\n\nBetter user experience: Investors don’t have to worry about rolling their position from one maturity to another\nMore uniform liquidity: Not having a maturity implies no risk of liquidity drainage when approaching the tranche expiration date.\nEnhanced composability: A token that expires at some point in time has a utility that is limited by its duration. Instead, a perpetual token can be easily used outside its native protocol for many different application\n\nPerpetual fixed-rate tranches could be used as collateral to borrow funds against or could be employed as a hedge against rate fluctuations to be added in a diversified portfolio.\n\nProject Tokenomics\n\nAs touched upon, Tranche’s token shifted to the SLICE token following the airdrop to JNT tokenholders in 2021. The token has three use cases:\n\nStaking: SLICE tokenholders can provide double-sided liquidity on different DEXes and stake their LP tokens to earn rewards. SLICE can also be staked directly on the protocol to serve a “backstop” function: In case of protocol insolvency, staked SLICE will be used to cover losses. Stakers are compensated by rewards in SLICE tokens that depend on the lockup period.\nGovernance: SLICE holders can propose and vote on governance proposals on the main parameters that govern the protocol functioning.\nHolding: Fees collected from Uniswap liquidity pools pairing SLICE and a stablecoin such as ETH/USDC/DAI will be used to purchase SLICE for the Tranche Treasury. This buyback mechanism would create buying pressure on the SLICE token as trading fee revenues consolidate around a stable trend.\n\nThe total supply is 20 million SLICE with allocation amounts vesting over multiple years. The amount allocated towards development will be unlocked linearly over 5 years. The team tokens will be unlocked over 5 years with a 2-year cliff. Should the supply of SLICE tokens need to increase, a Tranche Improvement Proposal (TRIP) to implement a 2% inflation mechanism can be voted on by the community at any date.\n\nThe Risk-Tranching Market\n\nIf someone wonders why a DeFi protocol should focus on risk-tranching derivatives, a detail may help put things in perspective: There’s a $ 610 trillion market out there.\n\nYeah, the total derivatives market is worth trillions. Interest rate derivatives in particular make up the lion’s share with $488 trillion as of June 2021, according to the Bank for International Settlements. Imagine what would happen if the crypto industry were able to capture just 1% of this market. That would amount to $4.8 trillion, almost 20 times the current total value locked in DeFi ($257 billion).\n\nGiven the opportunity in the market, competition is vast and only growing. Neutralizing or leveraging yield risk can be done through a variety of financial instruments. The landscape Tranche Finance competes in is much more complex than what would seem at first glance. Broadly, three categories of products can be highlighted in the yield risk management framework:\n\nYield Risk-Tranching: These protocols allow users to purchase tranches with fixed yield and limited risk or variable yield and unlimited downside. Tranche Finance belongs to this category together with Barnbridge, Saffron, NAOS Finance and 88mph. Out of these many protocols, Tranche Finance is differentiated as the only protocol with perpetual-based tranches.\nYield DEXes: These protocols allow users to split yield risk in a zero-coupon fixed yield token and a variable yield token with a certain maturity. The main players in this category are Pendle, Element, Tempus and Sense. Users can also trade zero-coupon and variable yield tokens against stablecoins (Pendle, Element) or one against the other (Tempus).\nYield Options: These protocols allow users to invest in automated trading strategies based on the price of yield-bearing tokens at a certain expiration date. Two of the most popular strategies used in protocols like Ribbon Finance and Opyn are covered calls (holding the yield-bearing token and selling a call on such a token) and put selling that allow investors to collect premiums upfront and benefit from steady future yields.\n\nThese three categories are not necessarily substitutes but can rather be seen as complementary to each. Each services its own niche and depending on the situation can provide investors with a wide range of strategies encompassing all the possible scenarios.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nThe main milestones the project is on track to accomplish in the next future are:\n\nThe on-chain voting and execution (Governance 2.0) will be implemented through GovernorBravo, the governance mechanism used by Compound. This will effectively provide tokenholders direct control of the treasury.\nUsers that deposit the likes of COMP, AAVE, MATIC will be entitled to earn Governance token rewards\nThe SLICE token distribution within the SIR mechanism will move from being epoch-based to perpetual\nStaking and tranching contracts will be revised to achieve higher gas efficiency\n\nAs far as growth, the Tranche Finance team was initially aiming for $20 million TVL by the end of 2022 but has experienced outperformance of expectations, leading them to revise the target to $50 million. The team has successfully executed the integration with Aave on Avalanche and Polygon, BenQi on Avalanche, and Yearn on Fantom. While interest in the protocol is great, it’s worth mentioning the team understands growth should never come at the expense of security. Tranche Finance has chosen a conservative approach to mitigate smart-contract risk. All smart contracts have been independently audited and the team is running a bug bounty program focused on preventing loss of user funds, economic exploits, and smart contract security risk. Payouts are denominated in US Dollars but are paid out through a mix of stablecoins and ERC-20 tokens. Furthermore, flash loans have been disabled: there is a minimum number of blocks that must be written between deposits and withdrawals. This restriction prevents the protocol from being a victim of flash loan exploits.\n\nBackers of the ecosystem expect DeFi to become a more hospitable environment for TradFi institutions over the next few years. This transition must bring sound and structured tools for holistic risk management to investors who want crypto to be a portion of a well-diversified portfolio. Tranche Finance has the right ingredients to navigate a nascent, yet very competitive, industry thanks to its multi-chain presence, solid incentive mechanism, and decentralized on-chain governance. Don’t be led astray by the low glamor and buzz around it, the future for risk-hedging products is bright and the inflow of smart money is only a matter of time.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Tranche Finance, a member of Messari Hub.

This release includes SIP-185, which adds three new Synths on Optimism with shorting: sAVAX, sMATIC, and sEUR.\n\nNotable Messari Governor Updates\n\nThe Redacted Cartel DAO has introduced a proposal that aims to approve a $5M FRAX credit line via Debt DAO in the form of a 6 month loan with 9% APR on drawn balance and a 2% APR on any undrawn balance. The loan will be repaid by farming fees collected via cvxCRV, cvxCRV/CRV LP, and vlCVX. The credit line would be used to allow greater liquidity for DAO expenses and attractive investment and market opportunities. <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/46fe036a-05a0-44da-9c7f-1ffd76f8a383\">Preliminary discussions</a> are ongoing.\nProtocol DAO has submitted a proposal that aims to add AAVE and UNI to Optimism for trading and shorting.

The goal is to diversify and increase Frax DAO treasury holdings and eventually return to paying 100% of AMO profit as rewards to veFXS holders when the price of BTC goes above $50k. <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/22f30d01-c684-442f-81ee-cf2c913a095a\">Preliminary discussions</a> are ongoing.\n\nSector Returns\n\nSectors across the board have seen negative returns for the week driven largely by the escalating Russia-Ukraine conflict. Three of the six sectors covered posted single-digit negative returns with currencies having the least decline, followed by smart contract platforms and top assets by market capitalization at -5.27%, -6.42% and -7.47% respectively. Entering double digit negative returns, Web3 declined 14.19%, followed by gaming with -15.31% and DeFi in last place with an 18.0% loss.\n\nTop Assets\n\nAll of the top assets by market capitalization traded in close synchrony as they made their decline this week with the exception of Terra (LUNA) which broke away from the pack heading into Tuesday. While all of the markets (not just crypto) have been experiencing drastic losses following the news of Russia invading Ukraine, Terra (LUNA) has been one of the few assets that have trended the opposite direction, bringing in an impressive return of 27.3% on the week. Cardano (ADA) was the laggard of the group with a 17.6% decline.\n\nDeFi Assets\n\nAlthough DeFi was the worst performing sector of the group, one of its top assets by market capitalization, Anchor Protocol (ANC) finished the week with a monumental 69.6% return. Anchor Protocol recently received a $450 million UST injection by the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) just as its reserves were drying out. While Maker had a muted weekly return, the rest of the assets within the DeFi sector returned double-digit losses. Curve secured the endmost position with a -23.8% return. DeFi TVL has recently descended from the $200 billion mark and is currently sitting at $193 billion.\n\nSmart Contract Platforms\n\nEven though the smart contract platforms sector did not have a double-digit loss week, it showed similarities to DeFi as it only had one winner (and by a large margin as well). Terra (LUNA) had an impressive week while the broader crypto and global markets are down, possibly related to the news surrounding the $1 billion raise aimed at establishing a bitcoin reserve for Terra’s UST stablecoin. The Cosmos IBC-based Layer-1 asset ended the week with a 27.3% gain. Near (NEAR) was the worst performer of the week, returning -20.9%.\n\nCurrencies\n\nFour of the ten assets within the top currencies by market capitalization returned single-digit declines (-4.8% to -9.9%) while the rest ranged from -10.2% to -17.3%. The asset with the least decline for the week was Bitcoin Cash (BCH) followed closely by Bitcoin SV (BSV) returning -4.8% and -5.0% respectively. Dash (DASH) took the last spot, returning -17.3% on the week.\n\nWeb3\n\nWeb3 tokens traded in a close pattern for most of the week with no clear outperformers. Arweave (AR) was the asset with the least decline for the week and also the only one that did not finish in double-digit loss territory. The data storage protocol brought in a 9.7% decline this week. Last place was secured by Theta (THETA) with a return of -23.9%.\n\nGaming\n\nSimilar to the previous two sectors covered above, gaming had no top assets by market capitalization that ended the week with positive returns. Only two assets, Aavegotchi (GHST) and Ultra (UOS) were in single-digit loss territory with -3.2% and -7.5% respectively while the rest had losses ranging from -12.5% to -22.6%. Enjin (ENJ) was the worst performer of the group.\n\n",

      "title": "Columbus-5: An Overview of Terra's Latest Upgrade",
      "content": "The following report was commissioned by Terra, a member of <a href=\"https://messari.io/hub\">Messari Hub</a>. For additional information, please see the disclaimers following the article.\n\nThe Terra blockchain and its native token, LUNA, have recently experienced unparalleled growth due to UST’s rapidly growing adoption. In 2021 alone, LUNA experienced a +14,000% change in market capitalization, and UST’s supply surpassed $10 billion.\n\nTerra's Columbus-5 upgrade, implemented earlier last fall, is mainly responsible for UST's recent supply growth. Columbus-5 was initiated with the primary goal of simplifying the economic design of Terra and improving the value capture of LUNA holders based on UST’s growth. The upgrade has largely achieved this by decreasing the liquid supply of LUNA through increased burning and staking and increasing the supply of UST by expanding its cross-chain prevalence. Increased cross-chain distribution of UST has also improved the security of the asset by removing the risk of dependence on a small number of protocols. Before delving into the specific details of Columbus-5, it is essential to establish background on Terra.\n\nTerra Basics\n\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/terra/profile\">Terra</a> is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol that creates decentralized, algorithmic stablecoins. While Terra can create stablecoins that track any fiat currency, UST has been its primary use case. Terra maintains UST’s peg of USD through an elastic monetary policy enabled by its dual, UST-LUNA token model. When the value of a unit of UST is above the USD peg, users are incentivized to burn LUNA and mint UST. When the value of a unit of UST is below the USD peg, users are incentivized to burn UST and mint LUNA. During times of UST contraction, LUNA valuation decreases, and during times of expansion, it increases. LUNA is the variable counterpart to UST. By modulating supply, LUNA's valuation increases as the demand for UST increases.\n\nLUNA holders secure the network by bonding their LUNA to a network validator. Bonded LUNA accrues staking rewards that come from three sources: gas, market stability fees, and swap fees. Users can stake their LUNA to a network validator through Anchor Protocol in exchange for bLUNA, a tokenized representation of bonded LUNA that can be traded freely or used as collateral on other protocols in the Terra network. Unbonding LUNA may take up to 21 days, during which rewards are not accrued.\n\nColumbus-5 Upgrade\n\nEconomic Changes\n\nSeigniorage occurs when LUNA is exchanged to mint new UST. Prior to TIP43 and Columbus-5, whenever UST was minted, the Terra Protocol would burn a portion of earned LUNA, and the rest would be diverted to fund various community projects. Due to the rapid pace of seignorage generation, Terra’s community pool and oracle reward pool became overfunded. In an effort to fix this and maximize value accrual for LUNA holders, Columbus-5 implemented the burning of all community pool funds and routed 100% of all future seignorage to be burned. Roughly 89 million LUNA was burned from the community pool. $1 billion worth of burned LUNA converted to UST was used to bootstrap Ozone, an algorithmic, claims-based insurance protocol on Terra. Ozone would later be taken over by Risk Harbor, an automated risk management protocol for DeFi.\n\nIncreased burning has led LUNA to become a radically deflationary asset and has improved its value capture based on UST’s growth. While community projects may no longer receive funding from seigniorage, other community-led programs have surfaced to fund new projects.\n\nSource: Murray Rudd Substack\n\nAs outlined in this article, UST/LUNA price dynamics, by Murray Rudd, increases in UST demand simultaneously result in the expansion of the LUNA demand curve and contraction of the LUNA supply curve. Given that the demand curve for LUNA is more inelastic at lower supply levels, increased demand for UST at lower levels of LUNA supply has an exponentially greater impact on LUNA price. As LUNA supply decreases, the actual amount of LUNA needed to be burned to mint UST also decreases. If UST adoption continues to grow over time, it is possible that LUNA supply will become essentially fixed at some low level in the future. Burning 100% of seigniorage will dramatically accelerate the reduction of total LUNA supply over time.\n\nOracle Developments\n\nValidator oracle votes are critical in maintaining UST issuance at correct prices. Before Columbus-5, oracle votes had the potential to be pushed out of the mempool during periods of high network demand. This precise situation occurred during the May 2021 market crash when a flood of other transactions boxed oracle votes out of blocks. Following Columbus-5, oracle votes will receive priority in the mempool so that they are never forced out of blocks during periods of network traffic surges.\n\nBefore 100% of seigniorage was burned, a portion of it was allocated to validators to encourage accurate oracle voting. To compensate validators for the loss of seigniorage rewards, Columbus-5 dividends swap fees to validators that would have otherwise been burned. This change has resulted in higher yields for staking LUNA and has dramatically increased the amount of LUNA staked.\n\nCross-Chain Advancements: Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)\n\nTerra is a Cosmos SDK blockchain utilizing Tendermint consensus. All blockchains built on the Cosmos SDK come natively with IBC, a standardized communication protocol for IBC compatible blockchains. Columbus-5 activated IBC functionality on Terra, enabling the seamless transfer of assets and data between Terra and other IBC-enabled chains such as the Cosmos Hub, Secret Network, Akash, Thorchain, and many more. Prior to Terra’s IBC integration, the IBC lacked a highly liquid stablecoin. Enabling IBC has enabled UST liquidity to flood into other IBC-enabled chains, and as hypothesized, UST has since become the dominant stablecoin pair on Cosmos’ most liquid DEX, Osmosis. As the Cosmos ecosystem continues to grow, UST’s growth stands to benefit immensely.\n\nIncreased demand for UST on other connected blockchains will continue to grow UST’s network effects and improve UST liquidity distribution. While UST’s cross-chain prevalence is improving, much outstanding UST supply remains heavily concentrated in a small number of protocols, such as Anchor. As UST’s cross-chain distribution grows, downward reflexivity to its peg and risk associated with its dependence on a small number of protocols is reduced.\n\nOther Developments\n\nWormhole V2\n\nWhile IBC connects Terra to application-specific blockchains on Cosmos, Wormhole connects Terra to disparate shared state machine blockchains such as Solana and Ethereum. While many current cross-chain bridges sacrifice a degree of decentralization in favor of convenience, Wormhole claims to retain the benefits of both. Wormhole operates as a decentralized oracle network that relays messages between chains, relying on the consensus of the connected chains to accept state changes between them. At the time of writing, $755 million UST has been bridged to other Wormhole integrated blockchains.\n\nMore recently, Wormhole suffered the largest recorded DeFi exploit in which over $326 million of ETH was stolen from the bridge. Jump Capital has since replenished all stolen funds, making all Wormhole users whole. Despite this setback, Wormhole remains one of the largest cross-chain bridges with over $2 billion locked.\n\nGrowth of Terra’s Ecosystem\n\nMany new projects have launched on Terra following Columbus-5, bringing in new use cases and utility to the blockchain. Recent project launches, such as Astroport, have rapidly bootstrapped liquidity and have propelled Terra to the second-largest blockchain to Ethereum with $14 billion TVL, nearly 7% of the TVL across all chains. Beyond new projects, increased risk management through Ozone will also likely grow the TVL of existing projects on Terra. As of the new year, Ozone launched with protection for Anchor specifically and will be launching integrations with Mirror and Orion soon.\n\nIncentive Programs\n\nTo further UST adoption on other blockchains, LUNA holders passed a governance decision in November 2021 to deploy $3 million of community pool UST (converted to LUNA) to various protocols’ liquidity pools across major L1s. More recently, LUNA holders voted to implement an additional liquidity mining program to deploy $2 million of LUNA to various protocols on Solana, Oasis, and NEAR.\n\nDespite recent growth in decentralized stablecoins, centralized stablecoins still dominate overall stablecoin liquidity. Because of this, Terra has aligned their interests with decentralized stablecoins MIM and FRAX to bolster decentralized stablecoins' share of the stablecoin market. Because the majority of stablecoin liquidity on Ethereum resides on Curve, LUNA holders recently voted to deploy a large amount of capital to incentivize deep UST liquidity on Curve. These incentives entail the deployment of $12 million in LUNA for Convex incentives, $250 million in UST to farm CVX/CRV via Curve’s USTw-3CRV pool, and $2 million in LUNA for Tokemak incentives.\n\nCompetition\n\nDAI and Centralized Stablecoins\n\nWhile DAI is technically a decentralized stablecoin, it is primarily collateralized by USDC, making it quite centralized relative to UST. Until UST surpassed it on November 18th, DAI was the largest decentralized stablecoin by market capitalization. UST’s supply is now 17% larger than DAI as it continues to grow at a rate faster than its more centralized peers. As shown by UST’s recent period of rapid growth, incentive programs can dramatically accelerate adoption. Although UST is far from eclipsing USDC or USDT, the combination of recent regulatory concerns around centralized stablecoins combined with UST, MIM, and FRAX’s collaboration to boost decentralized stablecoin liquidity on Curve may have the potential to change this narrative more quickly than others may realize.\n\nMIM\n\nAt this point, MIM is more of a companion than a competitor; however, it is still the second-largest truly decentralized stablecoin to UST. While many kinds of yield-bearing assets collateralize MIM, UST predominantly collateralizes it through its Degenbox strategy. It contributes to a significant amount of deposits on Terra's Anchor protocol. Abracadabra, like Terra, has also put forth considerable capital to incentivize the growth of UST and MIM on Curve by committing millions of dollars of SPELL emissions to Votium UST-MIM incentives.\n\nMIM and Abracadabra are also part of a much larger ecosystem of projects led by developer Daniele Sestagalli known as “Frog Nation” (SPELL, TIME, ICE, and SUSHI). In addition to Abracadabra, Wonderland has also contributed to UST adoption by deploying its most recent $48 million UST yield farming strategy. Although decentralized stablecoins like MIM may become long-term competitors to UST if their supplies begin to outpace centralized stablecoins like USDC and USDT, for the time being, their growth is symbiotic.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs of January 14th, 2022 Terra will reduce its tax rate to 0. LUNA stakers currently earn rewards through a combination of on-chain swap fees and network tax income. The tax rate is currently a deterrent for developers with capital constraints wishing to deploy contracts on-chain. Terra seeks to inspire more new developers to build on the blockchain and further promote innovation by reducing the tax rate.\n\nOther recently passed proposals involve the continued effort to bring UST liquidity outside the Terra ecosystem, further cementing it as a cross-chain stablecoin. This entails allocating:\n\n$60 million UST to seed MarketXYZ, Themis, and Rari Fuse pools.\n$1.7 million UST to enable bonds and incentives for OlympusDAO and InvictusDAO.\n$18 million UST to increase Votium incentives.\n$50 million to farm TOKE.\n$1.4 million in incentives to leading protocols on Avalanche, Fantom, and Moonbeam.\n$15 million to bootstrap liquidity on ZigZag Exchange which will onboard UST to zkSync and StarkNet.\n\nWhile most of Terra’s recent governance proposals have been aimed at improving UST’s cross-chain dominance, Terra’s latest proposal was marketing-focused. Following the approval of $40 million of community pool funds to be used for a sports partnership, Do Kwon announced that Terra would be partnering with the Washington Nationals. As part of the agreement, UST will become an accepted payment method at Nationals Park.\n\nConclusion\n\nTerra’s Columbus-5 Upgrade has propelled UST to the largest decentralized stablecoin and has created immense value for LUNA holders. The upgrade has set the path for UST adoption to continue to grow on other IBC-enabled blockchains and major L1s alike. LUNA supply will also experience greater contractions going forward following Columbus-5’s improved burning and staking mechanisms. More recently, Terra participants have set forth aggressive initiatives that attempt to further UST’s supply growth by increasing its cross-chain prevalence and real-life use cases. If these initiatives prove to be successful, LUNA holders will accrue immense value as a direct result of the changes implemented in Columbus-5.\n\n  \nThis report was commissioned by Terra, a member of Messari Hub.

      "content": "If you would like to view the full recording of the live Crowdcast event, you can find it on our Youtube channel. You can also read the full Quarterly Report by Mason Nystrom <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/the-state-of-livepeer?referrer=category:all-research\">here</a>.\n\nRyan Selkis (00:08): And we are live! GM! Everybody GM, and welcome to another amazing Crowdcast with one of our favorite founders in web3, Doug Petkanics from Livepeer. We got Mason from our team, who authored a terrific year end recap on Livepeer and Livepeer ecosystem. We’re going to deep dive today, but as a starting point for those that are new to Messari, or new to these presentations. Messari is a data and research aggregator, and we spent a lot of time over the last four years helping to work on data structures and standards for decentralized communities and the assets powering them. We, at this point, have covered several hundred assets in our research library, in depth. And everything from project history, the token economics, the security, the roadmaps, the governance structures. And one of the new things we've been engaging various communities on is actually taking the role of a quarterly analyst and synthesizing every new development on-chain and off-chain for a given community to help people get a snapshot on a somewhat regular basis of how these ecosystems are progressing and evolving. One of the core reasons that we’ve been doing this is to demonstrate the power of the interlaying ledgers themselves. You no longer need an investor relations team, or CFO or an internal finance team responsible for “disclosures”. This is open, public information and it really just matters, who's looking and who's ultimately only summarizing, aggregating this information. And as evidence today, we're going to do this as the third report of this kind that we've done. We’ve done similar reports and calls with Compound, Uniswap, and of course excited to branch out into a killer web3 application and video transcoding and everything the Livepeer community has been doing today. But importantly, Mason and our research team and data science team at Messari, created this report from scratch with basically no input from the Livepeer community other than the call we have today, for a kind of look ahead and discussion around some of the key community conversations, some of decision points, that the Livepeer community, and Doug and his team have been thinking through and maybe what to look for in the year ahead. So important starting point there. And I think one of the most exciting things in crypto, in general, is this dynamic can exist and you can essentially disaggregate an overview of an asset, or even quarterly update on an asset, completely from the core development team. Which is something that we’ve never seen before in finance and it’s obviously one of the killer apps we are excited to continue to build up infrastructure around at Messari. So with that plug over, the plug, slash, I guess disclaimer, Doug, for you. Just to be very clear about how we structure this and exactly you know, what we representing and what Mason is going to present as authoritative, and I think it is a jumping off point. We’ll let Mason go through the broad stokes of this annual report and we're excited to bounce around not only some of the questions and clarifications that he had that would interesting for this community but also dig into direct user questions as well as during the Q&A segment. So Mason take it away!\n\nMason Nystrom (03:50): Awesome, let’s get to it. We’ll drop the report in chat so everyone can access it on your laptop. Also, I’ll share my screen really quick so that we can kind of just walk through it broadly. So when we talk about the state of Liverpeer, there's a variety of metrics that are important to the Livepeer network. And so you know, hopefully, for those who are maybe less familiar about Livepeer, there's a few core ecosystem members and that really has to do with the demand side of Livepeer and supply side. So Livepeer as a video transcoding network, has broadcasters or essentially applications that need to get video transcoded. And that process is operated by the video miners in network who provide the actual computational transcoding services. These miners or node operators are referred to as orchestrators in the Livepeer network. And similar to how you have Bitcoin mining pools there’s also transcoding mining pools, where computational power is directed at the demand generation side that comes into the network. So with a broad overview of Livepeer we kind of get into what we defined as the core metrics of Livepeer. And that comes from the core metric being the amount of video transcoded on the network. So that's individual network—or total network usage. And you can see the quarter over quarter growth in this video transcoded usage has been quite impressive. And you know, Doug I would love your take. I think one of the kind of core improvements that happened in 2020, was this streamflow upgrade which added GPU bandwidth and since that point, we’ve seen this rapid evolution in terms of usage of the protocol. And then as we get into the other are metrics, we have orchestrator fee revenue, we have steaking rewards, which we can dive into, and then we have other important steaking metrics of the Livepeer network, such as the total Livepeer LPT that is distributed both the value of it, in quantity and in terms of the LPT itself, but also the USD rewards. And then also the net staked and percent total staked of the Livepeer ecosystem. And so with that as the framing of this report, we can dive into some of the data itself. And so kind of outlining the growth that I was discussing a little earlier, we've noticed the total video transcoded rapidly evolve and Livepeer has actually hit all time highs in network usage, each consecutive quarter for the year. Doug, I think it would be really quick, would love to hear where you’ve seen a lot of that usage come from, and expand into what types of applications are most utilized in the Livepeer network?\n\nDoug Petkanics (07:09): Sure thing. Thanks for having me here. Thanks for the overview and introduction to the project and for all the work on this report. And even before diving into like what these minutes are where they come from, just to help people understand what is this transcoding “thing” like why does that matter? Video streaming is 80% of the bandwidth on the internet. It's how we're broadcasting this call today. It’s how people are working, learning, interacting in real time. It’s a huge amount of the infrastructure on the internet goes to video streaming and a lot of it all runs through kind of the same big, centralized cloud providers, Amazon, Google, Microsoft. Livepeer’s an open video infrastructure that lets developers build video streaming applications for a variety of use cases, right? And so people use the Livepeer network to power this video streaming and one of the core pieces of functionality that needs to occur, that technical level is this thing called transcoding and that's taking input video like the video for this call today and converting it into different bitrates and formats that can play on your cell phone or your laptop, on a high bandwidth connection, on a low bandwidth connection, on a smart TV, et cetera. And that's what the kind of nodes and workers on our network are doing. And so Mason highlighted the metric that we care most about is not the market cap of the Livepeer token or anything speculative around crypto financial primitive its actually how much the fundamental usage is this network being used for, in terms of minutes and unique video, that are being encoded for distribution through the applications. So it's been good to see that growing. Back to your question Mason, where's this usage coming from? A lot of it's coming from the creator economy. It's coming from video streaming applications that allow users to go live and create and generate content stream what they want. Popular applications that are not built on Livepeer that people are familiar with are YouTube and Twitch, those are typical creator economy applications. They let their user stream for free, and Livepeer we see people building kind of independent products and services that look like YouTube or Twitch but maybe aren't beholden to that the attention economy an ad models of Google and Amazon who own those platforms, but instead help creators monetize by connecting directly with their fans are having ownership of their work from creation of NFTs, these sorts of things. And so we see this usage from apps that enable streaming for DJs, for musicians, for artists and their communities. A lot of these creative community specific streaming use cases. We also have seen users in eSports and gaming, competing with things like Twitch. We've seen users and kind of more B2B centric, like users of power sports streaming for local high schools and colleges, people that power events and screenings for conferences and meetups they can build on Livepeer infrastructure and use the network to power it. That's where a lot of the growth is coming. And it's been being driven by growing more maturation of our products and more marketing and awareness of our products, our intense streaming products, and a media server we can talk about called Mist. And it's also interesting it’s beginning to come from the web3 world and exciting to talk about, you know, the use cases we're seeing through streaming in the web3 world too.\n\nMason Nystrom (10:53): Yeah, definitely. Before we get into that I would love if you could maybe outline the benefits that these developers these applications get from using and leveraging Livepeer versus something like YouTube or Twitch. I know Livepeer is significantly cheaper in terms of infrastructure costs and so I'd love if you could briefly touch on why that is and how that enables developers or content creators or whoever they are to leverage this network.\n\nDoug Petkanics (11:28): Yeah, sure thing. The traditional attributes that a video developer would be looking for when they choose an infrastructure are, cost, reliability and quality, right? You have to deliver high quality, so you know the open-source software that we build in others contribute to leads to quality video experience. But cost is actually where Livepeer has the opportunity to make a huge impact as I mentioned, doing live streaming is difficult. You need servers standing by all around the world that have enough capacity for any streams that your users create, right? If you're creating something that looks like a Twitch, you don’t know how many users are going to show up at any moment to start streaming. You have to have these servers provisioned all around the world. It's very, very expensive to have them standing by sitting idle. And as a result, you see these cloud services charge typically like $3 per hour per input stream of video. So if you’re letting a thousand users stream that’s pretty expensive like $1,000 per hour, $1,000,000 per week or per month. What Livepeer does is it enables anyone with a GPU and bandwidth that happens to be sitting there to just be available such that if anyone shows up to stream and you’re Livepeer enabled, your GPU can earn money for doing this video encoding. And there's this really cool opportunity where there happens to be millions of GPUs deployed in data centers all around the world that are being used for mining cryptocurrency, so they're already around the world, they’re already distributed, they're already paid off and a working business model. But here's the cool thing. Those GPUs happen to have video encoding chips on them that can't hash crypto; they just sit there doing nothing, while the rest of the GPU is hashing crypto. And so what the Livepeer software does, is it says, “You don't have to disrupt your crypto mining. You can keep mining Ethereum or Z cash or whatever GPU coin you’re mining, but when there's video encoding work to be done, you’ll get additional revenue for doing that encoding at the same time.” And so that's a cool value proposition So they're cost, these miners, pennies per day in electricity or bandwidth, to use this component of their GPU, and that allows them to charge a price in the open Livepeer marketplace, that's more than pennies so they can actually made a profit, but still way less than $3 an hour or $72 a day that a cloud provider would be charging for video encoding. And so the Livepeer network at its core can be 10 to 100 times cost disruptive to the prices charged by a lot of cloud providers and that is pretty powerful.\n\nMason Nystrom (14:18): And as a follow up to that, what is the GPU capacity of the Livepeer network today?\n\nDoug Petkanics (14:25): Because it's open and decentralized I can't put an explicit number on it because you don't know how much capacity people have sitting here, but we know that there’s some large miners, some large infrastructure providers on it who have publicly stated the amount of GPUs they have, you know, in their network that they spread across on data centers, a number of you said is over 70,000 GPUs are available on the network. Keep in mind there's not infinite live video being created at any given moment because it takes human beings to be holding an event like this to create it. And so just that number of GPUs alone would be enough to encode all the video for Twitch,YouTube, and Facebook combined at any given moment. So not saying it's all sitting there ready to be Livepeer enabled and in the moment, but the partners that are running on the Livepeer network and operators on the Livepeer network have this capacity at their disposal. And because the video encoding tasks pay so much more than mining or other forms of usage for your GPU, it becomes a no-brainer for that supply to be available as demand warrants it.\n\nMason Nystrom (15:39): Yeah, thank you for that context and so now moving into like anything that is a good framing of the current use of the Livepeer network, as we get into the next forward looking the next year. I know that the Livepeer team has stated a variety of types of applications or use cases that you believe Livepeer would be incredibly suited for, whether it's video printing or recognizing songs in terms of licensing. I would love if you could outline two or three of the use cases you're most excited about how Livepeer might serve that use case or that customer base.\n\nDoug Petkanics (16:23): Cool yeah, I think there's two tracks that are interesting. One is like the additional futuristic video capabilities, right? We have and the other, I think, let’s pull it back to web3 a bit and talk about what we see in that web3, decentralized tech space. So for video capabilities, we talk about smart video tasks. This is like AI based compute on video in real time to do things like identify what type of video is this? Is it violent content, adult content, copyrighted content, because people are building consumer streaming applications need that information to do things like moderation, and make sure users have a good experience. And it just so happens these GPUs that are processing video on the network happen to be the same things that are used to do these AI based computations. So that's like identifying what type of video it is. Use cases are really excited about are object detection. So it's detecting what objects are appearing in a video stream, and making it actually interact with a clickable so that people can do interactive video experiences, whether that's game centric use cases like hosting a game show that the audience is clicking on video in order to interact with or E-commerce type experiences where you're selling and showcasing a product and allowing to show more information as you're hovering over it. I think there’s cool NFT use cases. I'm imagining all these NFT communities that use their profile pic NFT as their avatar. Imagine any video like this if your avatar was actually like, could be identified by AI and be hoverable and could show who owns it, what was it last sold for, what’s the link to OpenSea. So you need GPUs that are doing, kind of running algorithms on streaming video to be able to augment the video with that information. So I think those use cases that are in the R&D world are super exciting. The things are a little more here today that actively being worked on with design partners are like things that people like the crypto native projects are doing with video that is kind of unique, and needs these web3 native connections. So these are things like token gated streaming, where your DOAs and projects are like streaming content that they only want to be accessible to members of the community who maybe hold a social token, a membership token, or specific NFT in a collection. And so that's integrating wallets with access to output video streams. We saw five different projects built on that with Livepeer last weekend with the EthGlobal NFT hackathon. I think Metaverse streaming is really interesting like these metaverses like Decentraland are growing. People are gathering in these metaverses to view video streams from the real world like concerts that are being put on. Similarly, streaming video out of metaverses so what's it mean to have virtual cameras in these things and the hot sports that are showcasing to the real world what is going on at the casino or the concert hall or gaming venue in the metaverse. So seeing use cases around that. I think video NFT, live video NFT minting, there’s a whole creative canvass, I don’t know what the killer product there is but I know that creators interacting with their fans in real time and letting them mint and own some of the moments that are occurring is a way that creators are able to better monetize than just slapping ads on top of their stream, and so making sure that Livepeer can be integrated for those use cases. And the last one I would mention is—I think you guys highlighted this at Mainnet really well—we're not in a world where every single thing is built on Ethereum anymore. There’s all of these developer ecosystems across layer 1 and layer 2 scaling solutions and making sure they all leverage Livepeer as their video infrastructure. Even though Ethereum is the core payments mechanism today, so doing work to think about cross chain support.\n\nMason Nystrom (20:50): And given those applications— there’s obviously—since Livepeer is a public network anyone can build on top of it and Liveper.com is one such hosted application. Could you kind of explain a little bit about Livepeer.com and I’d love to get into the important acquisition you guys made back in November of Mist server. And dive a little depper into why that’s important and what it’s going to enable the Livepeer team, and just in general the Livepeer ecosystem to do.\n\nDoug Petkanics (21:28): Livepeer is an open project and an open public network, like you said anyone can participate and build anything. For the first two years of the project, a lot the core team just focused on building that out. And then we reached this moment, we built it, we have this bootstrapped supply side of global node operators, it’s working, but we need to actually build products and services that make it easy for the demand side to adopt this network without worrying about blockchain, crypto, decentralization, and that's when, even though we always have this company that Eric Tang and I co-founded, called Livepeer Inc. and our mission was to kind of steward the Livepeer project and focus on growing the adoption of the Livepeer network. This company can take an active role in building the product services and commercial relations to onboard demand into the network. Livepeer Inc. is just one actor in this network, but an important one. Decentralizing over time through other people building various key components that users use to interact with it. The product, the first product that we built, was called Livepeer.com, it was end to end streaming APIs. Any developer could show up, register an API key and stream and leverage the power of the Livepeer network. And we did things that made it easy for them to do that. [We] hosted Livepeer nodes all around the world to serve for them for their video. We allowed for credit card payment. This is when you show the growing adoptions of minutes steamed on the network going up and to the right this year. We launched the first version of that product in January, and then it got better in Q2, and we onboarded more users in Q3, and in Q4 we had just gotten to this important milestone and moment that you referenced, which was the first acquisition that Livepeer the company did of this great company in the Netherlands called DDVTechnical, the product is called MistServer. And MistServer is this piece of video software that developers all around the world from indies to enterprises use in their video workflows, and they’ve been a partner for a long time. They had integrated with Livepeer, so their users could use the Livepeer network for their transcoding. A lot of our usage was coming through those users. We also use their product to build this Livepeer.com, this global intense streaming service. And so really excited to join forces with a great technical team there right outside Amsterdam. And the end result of this is we believe we’re going to have, continue to invest in their technology and innovation and we’ll be able to pair the world’s best open video software that anyone can use to build a video application with the world’s most scalable affordable reliable open video infrastructure that they use to scale their streaming application and provide the infrastructure that the software runs on and that is a really powerful combination that in enabled that because of token incentivized models and token coordinated models where we all collectively benefit from increased usage of this network. That is the business model as opposed to just charging people when you sell your software to them or licensing like this close proprietary thing and I think that it’s powerful it’s hard to compete with if you’re saying, “you have to buy our software, and you have to pay Amazon “x” amount for every server you run it on.” Where it’s like, you can use this software, this open software, and you have this more cost-effective open network to run it on. So tons of work to do to actually like, make sure the product is amazing, meets developer needs, but just from a positing perspective, I think it’s super powerful in crypto and blockchain networks enabled.\n\nRyan Selkis (25:40): Doug, how much of the network capacity is getting funneled to the Livepeer Inc. hosted services versus third party video services or interfaces that have been built. I assume during the bootstrapping phase it might have been predominantly Livepeer Inc. powered front ends, how do you think about the scale out of that and where is the mix right now?\n\nDoug Petkanics (26:04): That’s right, it’s the majority. The majority is coming through Livepeer Inc. front ends, whether that be the .com streaming service or Mist itself. I think the things that you see—it’s interesting, if you count it by minutes streamed through the network the majority comes through that. Where you see people begin to build directly on it is more in this experimental, web3 world, which shouldn’t be surprising. You show up to a web3 hackathon, you’re comfortable, you can build directly on the network. And so there you see cool example use cases and experiments and hacks emerge. And those are powerful operational examples, but they may only represent like a hundred minutes of video a week versus the millions of minutes of video a week you might see through scaled applications on Livepeerinc.com. So definitely excited to focus on mechanisms to decentralize that over time.\n\nRyan Selkis (27:06): One of the things that strikes me as high potential would be mirroring a centralized service. So if there were the ability to one click “add a Livepeer redundancy” to the steam. Have you seen experimentation there? Maybe this is something you’re building at the Inc. or maybe this is something you’ve seen materialize in the community. Because the marginal cost to run that experiment is not too high and there might be ways to incentivize those experiments, number one, because long-term, if people start to trust the reliability of that as an alternative and can see a 50-75%+ cost reduction. That’s one bootstrapping and onboarding mechanism that would have promise. I’m just not sure if that UX is there yet or if that’s in the works.\n\nDoug Petkanics (28:06): We’ve actually seen that technique play out effectively when it comes to getting people to evaluate Livepeer and to build up and gain trust that a decentralized network can deliver on the reliability they need. Getting deep into the weeds about how video works and video engineering, typically like every two seconds of video is another file, and when you’re receiving that, you’re kind of reading, what’s the next file, what’s the next file, what’s the next file. And the way the video tech works behind the scenes is you can have a primary and backup file in that playlist so the player can request a backup if they can’t get the primary. And we’ve seen people, test this out by using the Livepeer encodings as the backup and their existing provider as the primary, and that’s what gives them the trust of “I’ve integrated, it’s working, it actually delivers this video in real time.” And then eventually switch over to using Livepeer, so good suggestion, good sales tactic.\n\nRyan Selkis (29:10): Well we’re using Crowdcast and I think we’d obviously love to eat our own dog food in general, and if there were integrations or basically ways to install a plug in. I think one of the most underutilized but technically complex things to build would just be a series of extensions for web3 applications to mirror your web2 applications as a slow-motion user vampire attack, whatever you want to call it. Maybe there is a unicorn there for just building the abstraction tools for a number of web3 services, but something that is kind of top of mind. Instead of just trying to compete directly head on. Can you prove the backup works first?\n\nDoug Petkanics (29:55): Keep the vampire attacks ideas coming and the unicorn ideas coming because one of our challenges, the hurdles we’ve had, there’s so many people in the web3 world and the creator world that want to see a web3 disruptor to a Youtube or a Twitch or whatever kind of centralized application, and they come to Livepeer thinking that is what we are. And then they have this slight moment or realization that it's actually an infrastructure and you still need a product visionary, so I’m going to use that infrastructure to build the web3 Crowdcast or the web3 Twitch or the web3 Youtube, and then that would be the thing that these thousands or millions of creators would latch onto. And by the way I don’t think it looks just like a clone of Twitch or clone of Youtube. I don’t think that’s interesting, I think it needs to be something new and innovative that leverages better creator economics through NFTs or tokenization or crowd-funding or whatever the mechanic is. I think this is the year we will see a lot of those entrepreneurs and product visionaries and hackers actually be able to piece together not just Livepeer, but Livepeer, The Graph, Arweve, Sia, Filecoin, Helium like all these web3 primitives to build some of these cool new applications that reach a million people.\n\nMason Nystrom (31:20): I think you bring up interesting points around just making these applications easier across the board for the demand side is a key driver of growth. A lot of these networks, Livepeer included, the supply side is largely there and it’s just how do we make the consumption easier on some of these networks. Maybe pivoting a little to scalability, and Livepeer has made some key decisions in terms of the future of the protocol, specifically in regards to the Confluence upgrade. So we would love to talk briefly about the Confluence upgrade, I know it was part of that Livepeer is migrating to Arbitrum. I would love to hear how you guys went about deciding that process, why Arbitrum versus another L2, and some of the benefits that migration is going to bring.\n\nDoug Petkanics (32:23): Yeah, sure thing. Really excited about this. It is a huge pain point in our network as the Ethereum fees have risen so much over the last year was that it was kind of too expensive for a new node operator to join the network and get started or too expensive for token holders to, or stakers to claim their fees and whatnot. So we’ve really been doing all the research and whatnot to figure out all the right scaling solution that mitigates some of these impacts. Confluence is the codename of the upgrade we have been working on for a while, it’s actually really close to going live, it’s on a test net right now. We’re on phase two of the test net, which means we’re actually live on Arbitrum ranked B test net. And the audit process is nearly complete so we’re literally in the last couple of weeks before we should be live on Arbitrum. The impact that we’re looking for here is dramatic 10x cost reduction for participation in the network. Which should really open up more access to more node operators, more delegators to take an active role to move their stake around from node to node and respond to network events, and grow the community as a result. We’ve always been a huge partner and believer in the Ethereum ecosystem, we’ve been built on Ethereum, great developer experience, we have a lot of expertise there. Evaluating scaling solutions we thought it was important that there was great developer tooling, testing capabilities, a huge developer ecosystem that’s battle tested and found support around these things. So that has kept us looking at solutions that were very Ethereum integrated. We also really valued practicality and usability today or soon over theoretical gains you will get in the future. So the way the timing lined up it wasn’t looking to make a huge migration that makes a bet on an entirely other immature ecosystem, it wasn’t waiting for general purpose ZK computation even though that might ultimately be a super scalable path. It wasn’t waiting for ETH2 roadmap to play out, it was looking, how can we deliver incremental value gains to our users in the short term and so Arbitrum was a great choice, excited about the progress there. It is not going to represent 1000x cost savings, it’s not going to make transactions free, there’s always iterative stuff that comes beyond that, but it’s delivering a big win to users in the near term.\n\nMason Nystrom (35:08): I think an important point you bring up is, it will be easier for some of the interesting economics of Livepeer to become more prevalent, and so delegators specifically, being able to switch their delegation more freely, move to different orchestrators if they think someone is providing a better service because right now it is a little prohibitive for any small delegator to allocate capital differently each week just because of the Ethereum gas fees. And so do you think there will be any type of change to which orchestrators have the most delegation given that it will be easier to redelegate from the longtail from potential stakers?\n\nDoug Petkanics (35:55): I hope so, and I think it will. To give a little background, the reason this matters is in Livepeer the more stake that a node has, the more security it is providing to the network and therefore the more work it can perform and the more fees it can earn. So the nodes that have more stake are kind of competing and able to do more work and earn more fees. There’s a second concept that’s interesting, we call it inflation funding. It’s the notion these node operators, they actually everyday, they get to mint new Livepeer tokens according to how much stake they have and some of that flows back to the token holders who have delegated towards them, but the node operators keep a cut, they keep a commission if you will. And the notion is, “hey Livepeer is going to able to fund things in a decentralized way through this inflation.” If someone is running a node and campaigning on the contributions they’re making to the network, maybe they’re building an application, maybe they’re helping onboard demand, maybe they're investing in hardware to provide this great service. People can help fund those efforts by staking towards them and helping them keep a little bit of the future earnings. And a barrier to this is it has just been too expensive to split my stake into ten different accounts and support ten different nodes, and move it around and do all these transactions because you have thousands of dollars of Ethereum fees and overhead. But as you have cost effective staking with the click of a button for a couple cents, and you can move stake around and you can split it to support different nodes. The role that I want to see token holders and delegators play is let’s activate new nodes that are high performing, help them earn more work because they are going to be sharing more fees back to me, and they’re helping the network succeed. Let’s move some stake in the inflation fund, people are making great contributions and let’s work together collectively to make sure this network has global coverage and service in every region and high performing orchestrators in every region. Bringing down the cost and opening up that accessibility is going to be a big, big game changer for all three of those factors that I’m excited about.\n\nMason Nystrom (38:05): Definitely. For a little more context on the L2 migration that’s specifically for the Livepeer staking contracts, is Livepeer thinking about having multiple instances of the same contact running on different L2s or is it going to be more convenient to have everything in one specific scaling solution?\n\nDoug Petkanics (38:32): So for the supply side of the network, the people who run nodes, receive payments, and stake tokens, we think it is most convenient to have one point of access for that and inform one network that is coordinated in one place, so that’s on Arbitrum. By the way, when unstaked tokens can cross back over the bridge, back to Ethereum to get that composability with existing DeFi, with exchanges for deposits with withdraws et cetera, so it is that Arbitrum and Ethereum connection and bridge. I want to highlight though, for users, for people that want to build and leverage Livepeer as developers, this is where we are really interested in the cross chain. And so what’s it look like for you to be able to off your wallet on any chain or layer 2 and establish credits for payment that you have for streaming whether that is making deposits directly or for tapping into an off base credit system from your ecosystem fund or whatnot. [These] ideas are being shaped and explored now, but I think from a user’s perspective you should be able to build on this network from any chain.\n\nQ&A:\n\nMason Nystrom (39:50): I think that gives us, considering the first question we have in the chat, a good starting point to dive into questions from anyone in the audience and so we can start with Tom’s question, “You talked about being excited about a multichain world. Is Livepeer considering deploying on other L1s, either currently or given over the context of this next year?”\n\nDoug Petkanics (40:20): Yeah, I think as I just articulated I think the, we think about other L1 ecosystems having like crypto native access to use Livepeer to build applications. So if the next killer decentralized social application is being built in the Polygon ecosystem or the Tezos ecosystem like those, those developers should be able to use Livepeer in a way that's not “swipe your credit card at Livepeer.com”, it's probably off your wallet and just deposited funds on your native chain—because remember, no video ever touches the blockchain, that's all kind of done peer to peer through the network. So the key is proving through your signature, through your digital identity, that you kind of have deposited credit in order to stream and then payments can get settled accordingly to the to the node operators, and I think that sort of bridging and access control and payments mechanism is the layer where the cross chain ecosystems come into play.\n\nMason Nystrom (41:24): Thank you, I think that’s helpful context. And payments are in Eth for transcoding services?\n\nDoug Petkanics (41:32): Yep, yep under the hood, payments are settled in Eth. I actually think, you know, stablecoin might make more sense because it would be less volatile for pricing, I think we just put that on the protocol upgrade priority list as a scaling gets solved and as time allows. Eth is what is used under the hood to settle payments.\n\nMason Nystrom (41:53): I like that, I think it would definitely make it easier in terms of pricing.\n\nDoug Petkanics (42:01): You guys put together all the reporting information about dollar value of Eth, dollar values of staking rewards and almost be adjusted based on the swings of the price of Ethereum, the price of Livepeer token. You've done a nice job. I saw that in the quarterly report you linked to a Dune Analytics dashboard that has all the raw data available. So there's a nice approach you took.\n\nMason Nystrom (42:25): And for anyone who is curious about the Dune dashboard, I just dropped it in the chat, you can see real time metrics that we tracked. Pretty much every metric that we’re able to get on chain from Livepeer.\n\nDoug Petkanics (42:41): Following up on that, I know Ryan started this session with what he called a plug for third party research replacing the internal IR or financial reporting function of a company like that’s a plug that is so valuable and true, right? Like we're a small technical team that builds video infrastructure and not a publicly traded behemoth that has an IR department that can produce like quarterly financial reports but we see so much value in transparently making sure everyone is aware of network fundamentals, usage, core metrics, like there’s so much value in doing that. I like the notion that Messari or a whole community can come together to provide that's well done.\n\nRyan Selkis (43:32): Well Doug, my pitch for four years has been we're better than the SEC. And so we can’t double back on it now. But we're getting there slowly but surely, and I obviously said tongue in cheek, but I think anyone that actually uses a network like Livepeer would be tough to come with a straight face and see similarities to a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ for instance. I think it’s fundamentally different to be able to extract all this information from an open ledger to know that the control and decision making over that entire network is not completely controlled by one team. And to recognize a reality that if all these are different assets are going to live somewhere on a spectrum from fully centralized, just taking the idea at inception. Bitcoin was centralized when Satoshi wrote the white paper because it was just in his head, and all the way to the whatever the platonic ideal is of full decentralization will never actually hit in any network. And I think one of the important things to call out, Mason linked to the Dune dashboard, the fact that someone like Messari can interoperate with The Graph and Dune and some of the other open information products have been built, I think just going to accelerate that process of getting more information like this structured and disseminated in a way that ultimately, helps us from a public relations standpoint, but also just from general stakeholder communications. And now we're starting to see alerting functionality built into wallets. So the innovation that’s going to unlock in terms of being able to basically direct message a link to a quarterly update from a protocol team or not even from the team itself necessarily but maybe from the community member like Messari. I think that the amount of innovation that can be unlocked from there is—it just continues to compound.  Obviously we're excited to keep working with good projects. That have been building bull or bear for years now.\n\nDoug Petkanics (45:52): Awesome, completely agree. I don't know what all the analysts are doing waiting for today's 5:30pm, Elon Musk quarterly Tesla call when they should be in the world where they’re just looking at the Dune analytics dashboard a couple days in advance.\n\nRyan Selkis (46:09): Yeah, look, we would welcome other teams to front-run us on other projects, you know, it's a big market. And I think the way we view this quarterly and ongoing reporting for communities is, there's going to be a handful of service providers that are embedded with different protocols communities, and maybe the service is analogous to us being one of the big four auditors that’s engaging and in the weeds with different projects. I’d say today, we're probably in a class of our own but I think we’d obviously expect and welcome others to step up because there's more projects than we would be able to work with out of the gates for sure. I think this is the stuff that's going to be important, not only for us to host but important for—to see created and standardized in a way that this information be accessible on Messari on other third-party sites, whether it’s Coinmarketcap, Bloomberg, or anything in-between.\n\nMason Nystrom (47:15): As we round this out. I think we’ve answered a lot of the questions. But there's one that I wanted to surface that we didn’t necessarily discuss, and that is “What do video players—What video players and interfaces do the creators use if the transcoding service is powered by Livepeer? Are they using a custom video player or the Livepeer platform?”\n\nDoug Petkanics (47:40): Really good question. Right now they can use whatever video player they want. There’s a series of open-source ones, MistServer, which is a part of the Livepeer project as a player that they could use embed and some browsers they play video natively. So [the] video player is up to them. Going forward I think the world is open video infrastructure, and the world’s best software, you should have a great open player that is decentralized by nature, and that it has these primitive decentralization based features whether that's integration with wallet faced identities, or tapping into the smart video that can identify digital IDs through profile pics, like I gave examples before I think there's opportunity there. But for now, it's pick your own solution.\n\nMason Nystrom (48:36): Awesome. Thanks for that clarification. Excited about everything Livepeeer has done in 2021. And looking forward to a myriad of upcoming ’22 events, including the full migration of the Confluence upgrade. Is there any final thing that you're most excited about this next quarter or this next year?\n\nDoug Petkanics (49:03): I think it's the year that like I said, that we're going to see like consumer social applications reach the mainstream that are powered with crypto primitives. We're going to see the next TikTok emerge with crypto primitives built in because it's better for the creators, it’s better for the consumer to own their platform I think video will be a part of it. So Livepeer’s an open community we want to help people create enable these things, check us out at Livepeer.org. Join our Discord and there’s a lot people there that are building, that are excited to be apart of that, and partner up with you. So that's the call to action. But thanks so much for hosting this call and having me was great, and I will talk to you all soon.\n\nMason Nystrom (49:51): Thank you, Doug!\n\nRyan Selkis (49:53): And thank you everyone for joining. We'll see you again for another update soon. More coming! Check out Messari.io, subscribe to the newsletter for more updates like this. See ya everyone!",

      "content": "The following report was commissioned by Forte, a member of <a href=\"https://messari.io/hub\">Messari Hub</a>. For additional information, please see the disclaimers following the article.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n  \nThe landscape of blockchain-based gaming is rapidly expanding behind the rise of NFTs and in-game currencies. Its growth can be seen as a continuation of a multi-decade iteration across monetization strategies and business models.\n\nThe rise of worldwide interest in video games and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the last few years serve as large catalysts. Globally, the number of video gamers is quickly approaching 3 billion with a projected 5-7% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next few years. Meanwhile, NFT sales surpassed $15 billion for the first time ever in 2021. In fact, secondary sales of the NFTs found in blockchain games themselves accounted for 20% of total NFT sales – with dozens of smaller games consistently generating tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.\n\nFinally, while the metaverse remains vague, it’s clear that gaming, in particular, has a strong presence in virtual worlds. Virtual world games, like Decentraland and The Sandbox, have generated nearly $500 million in cumulative NFT sales (virtual land and in-game assets). In 2021, virtual world NFT sales witnessed the largest growth, generating over $320 million in transaction volume. As the global understanding of the metaverse further contextualizes, it’s likely that some portion of this new digital experience will utilize blockchains as a core piece of infrastructure – something even more likely to occur as blockchain infrastructure continues to scale to meet the demands of developers and consumers.\n\nThis report will dive deeper into the growth of all three categories: Global gaming, NFT markets, and blockchain games. Though  the industry remains in its infancy, understanding these trends will help provide insights into what the future of gaming may hold.\n\nIntroduction to Blockchain Gaming\n\n  \nLike its fictional characters, the business of games keeps evolving. The industry lies at the edge of disruption, where it has historically discovered innovations and adapted them to ever-changing demands.\n\nTake the evolution of gaming business models as an example. The first mainstream games featured a pay-to-play system. We remember these games predominantly as arcade machines in malls or CD discs in computers or, later on, direct downloads onto machines. The advantage with pay-to-play was simple: Pay just one time; keep playing forever.\n\nAfter pay-to-play came the freemium model of games. Gamers no longer needed to pay to start playing a game in this era. Rather, companies made revenue from players paying to unlock additional components of the game, or more commonly, from sales of in-game purchases such as expansion packs, platform subscriptions, and character cosmetics. For many, freemium games lowered gaming’s barriers to entry and the shift to freemium games helped grow the number of gamers around the globe.\n\nThat takes us to today, where the beginnings of gaming’s next monetization revolution lie around the corner: blockchain gaming. The blockchain gaming sector has earned other names like GameFi or play-to-earn indicative of the new monetization models of this gaming era. Blockchain gaming typically incorporates non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or other forms of tokenized assets as in-game content tradeable for cryptocurrencies – or fiat currency – on markets facilitated by the blockchain. Thus, this core monetization strategy occurs in the form of sales of tokenized assets and subsequent royalty proceeds. Game studios and players share aligned incentives in this new business model since both parties benefit when the game’s tokenized assets increase in value.\n\nAt the heart of this revolution is the idea that gamers should own the content they earn, or at least have more ownership in the digital worlds in which they spend a significant portion of their time and money. This creates two immediate advantages: (1) The longevity of in-game assets increases as those assets continue to exist in their owners’ wallets even after the game is turned off, and (2) both the interoperability and composability of assets – terms describing their portability – enable them to interact with other games, applications, or blockchains. Interoperability among different blockchains allows gamers to lend out their in-game assets, port them to another application, or gain access to real-world events. In addition, blockchains have the potential to offer gamers the ability to safely and efficiently buy, sell, trade, and create in-game assets with fiat or crypto even within the same application; gray secondary markets for games can be rife with fraud, and many emerging markets lack the payments infrastructure for gamers to seamlessly make game-related transactions.\n\nWhile blockchain gaming can be a new monetization source for game studios, it should be warned that the decision to enter the world of blockchain doesn’t come without its own pitfalls. The recent announcement of Ubisoft Quartz, an in-game NFT marketplace of sorts, was met with skepticism from fans, leading to plans of including NFTs in the new game Tom Clancy Ghost Recon Breakpoint getting scrapped. This followed after the popular gaming community Discord saw similar pushback after hinting at integration with Ethereum. The main reasons behind the community pushback were sustainability, unclear user value proposition and the prevalence of rug pulls, among many others. Many if not all of these concerns could have been avoided or alleviated with more deliberate, thought-out rollouts alongside market education; introduction of NFT profile pictures by Twitter and Adidas’ foray into NFTs have shown an encouraging path forward for platforms and intellectual property owners to learn from.\n\nThe Global Gaming Market\n\nGaming is one of the most popular sources of entertainment and it is only expanding. Major franchises such as Fortnite and League of Legends now operate in the global pop culture arena. Fortnite, for example, has partnered with Marvel Studios, Star Wars, and John Wick in the movie industry, worked with Ariana Grande, Neymar, and other influential celebrities, and coordinated with popular brands such as Balenciaga, Ferrari, and Air Jordan. League of Legends, on the other hand, hosts an international-sports league drawing millions of fans.\n\nAnecdotes aside, the global gaming market cannot be evaluated without taking the last two years into perspective. In 2020, lockdowns caused by the Covid-19 pandemic acted as a strong catalyst for the industry. Those who were already gamers found themselves with more time to play their favorite games. Meanwhile, individuals who didn’t play games found themselves with time on their hands to experiment with fresh hobbies. Consequently, global gaming revenue grew 15% in 2020. Mobile, PC, and console games each saw growth with mobile, in particular, surging 26% year over year.\n\nUnfortunately, businesses in 2021 faced a different story. The pandemic’s prolonged disruptions began to highlight unexpected second-order effects in the global gaming market. Disruptions to manufacturing, freight, and logistics processes hindered the launches of next-generation consoles, and PC hardware faced chip shortages and delays on other high-end components.\n\nDespite the ongoing increased interest in gaming seen in 2020, both PC and console segments saw slight decreases compared to 2020 and mobile was the only category to experience growth, due to these supply chain disruptions and tough comps.\n\nForecasts do expect the gaming industry to revert back to the previous levels of growth once the effects of Covid-19 subside. Predictions have the industry reaching $269 billion by 2025, a 53% increase from recent numbers. Over the upcoming three-year period, these fall in line with recent years’ historical 15% CAGR growth, driven by continued changes in consumer behavior post-pandemic and new revenue monetization models from streaming and professional esports.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of total gamers worldwide is predicted to hit just under the three billion mark with 55% coming from the Asia-Pacific region. The main drivers for an ever-increasing user base remain an expanding internet population, better networking infrastructure, and easier accessibility to smartphones.\n\nThese three drivers outlined continue to be reliable for the short term, but as more of the world comes online in regions such as the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America and user growth slows, exploring new avenues to increase participants will be of interest to many companies. Blockchain gaming and its new token-based monetization models present a unique opportunity for game developers to generate more in-game revenue per customer, broaden their customer base, and explore new revenue streams.\n\nNon-Fungible Tokens: Game Changers\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) act as a core primitive for blockchain assets and as a key value proposition of various blockchain games. NFTs in blockchain games provide various benefits to games including asset ownership, asset programmability, and open new opportunities to incentivization and innovation.\n\nAsset Ownership  \nIn legacy games, in-game assets are controlled and owned by the game developer and effectively rented out to players. Comparably, in blockchain games, players retain genuine ownership over their digital assets, whether in-game currency or more unique assets like skins, account names, in-game land, or other assets.\n\nAsset Programmability  \nSince NFTs are essentially software on blockchain networks, these assets can be programmed to have various qualities or built with in-game utility. NFTs can be designed with single-usage, unlockable content, issued to players that achieve a certain status, or programmed with a number of other unique use cases.\n\nIncentivization and Innovation  \nGame developers are already amongst the most knowledgeable when it comes to incentives. NFTs offer an additional layer of economic incentives by enabling players to earn yield-generating assets, imbue gaming assets with real financial value, and build a more robust gaming economy via in-game currencies and NFT marketplaces.\n\nSince blockchain networks are permissionless, they open up the doors to developer innovation. With NFTs, a single asset category can be automatically licensed to other companies or leveraged in other games. Sorare – the fantasy soccer NFT game – has licensed the usage of its NFTs with other game developers like Ubisoft.\n\nFinally, NFTs also open new forms of monetization. For instance, NFTs issued by companies can earn royalties on all secondary sales producing a new revenue stream for digital asset issuers. Companies can choose to vertically integrate their own marketplaces and activities or integrate with third-party platforms like OpenSea.\n\nThe Growth of NFTs: Analyzing The Secondary Market\n\nTotal NFT secondary sales in 2021 surpassed $15 billion across multiple blockchain networks. As a platform, Ethereum leads NFT sales. However, increased transaction costs on the network have paved the way for newer blockchains and Layer-2 scaling solutions like Solana, Ronin, ImmutableX, Polygon, and more.\n\nEach blockchain or Layer-2 comes with its own set of tradeoffs, including scalability, existing infrastructure, users, and security among others. As such, there’s a variety of game developers building on different blockchains for different reasons. Games that require greater scalability might opt for blockchains like Solana while game developers desiring to utilize Ethereum’s  \nexisting network effects may select Polygon, ImmutableX, or another Ethereum scaling solution.\n\nIn hindsight, August 2021 was the peak monthly activity in 2021 with over $4.5 billion in NFT secondary sales.\n\nAlthough the last few months of 2021 still lagged compared to the peak, it’s important to realize the NFT secondary market is still multiples larger than where it was at the start of 2021. With a growing number of applications and marketplaces that integrate various forms of tokens including NFTs, the NFT secondary market will be poised to retest the level of engagement last seen during August 2021.\n\nNote these charts represent secondary sales, meaning the sale from one person to another. This data, therefore, excludes the initial NFT sale from the gaming company to the first buyer, which can produce meaningful revenue. Secondary sales are a useful metric for gauging the health of both the overall NFT market and the health of an individual game. Increased secondary sales likely translate to a more robust gaming economy and since NFT collections often pass a perpetual royalty to the company at each sale, a healthy secondary market also directly corresponds to increased revenue for the NFT issuer.\n\nData shows Axie Infinity is the clear leader in secondary NFT sales, the vast majority of which occur on its sidechain Ronin. More recently, ParallelAlpha, another strategy card game, has grown in recent months in part due to its intriguing SciFi backstory and intellectual property. Overall, there exist several successful games with over $100 million in secondary NFT sales across multiple blockchain networks, showing that there’s still no clear consensus on which platform is best suited for blockchain-based games.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is the fact that most successful blockchain games today are predominantly card games, compared to the existing gaming industry which favors sandbox games, MMORPGs, and games with more robust gaming experiences.\n\nCurrently, blockchain games are not at the stage of development in which they can support both complex gameplay and economic primitives like NFTs at scale. However, in time, advancements in blockchain technology and user experiences – including improvements launching in the coming year – will open the doors for higher functioning games that operate on blockchain networks.\n\nThe Blockchain Gaming Landscape\n\nAs the blockchain-gaming sector gains momentum, the gaming infrastructure stack has also quickly evolved and is now composed of an ecosystem of studios, games, and key pieces of infrastructure.\n\nLet’s break down the various layers of the blockchain gaming landscape.\n\nGaming Guilds\n\n  \nGuilds aren’t new to blockchain gaming. These social groups – guilds – have been utilized in role-playing games for decades. However, the combination of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)—an entity formed by a community that is organized around a set of rules enforced on a blockchain, usually with no central leadership structure—and gaming enables these guilds to ingest and allocate capital which creates new models for gaming financialization and user acquisition. Well-capitalized guilds like Yield Guild Games, GuildFi, and Merit Circle have sponsored—delegated assets in exchange for part of the game rewards—hundreds of players for games like Axie Infinity.\n\nBlockchain Games\n\nThe largest layer of the blockchain gaming landscape is the games themselves. To date, there exist a variety of game types. Some of the most successful categories include trading card games (e.g. Axie Infinity), MMORPGs(e.g. DeFi Kingdoms), Virtual Worlds (e.g. The Sandbox), and sports games (e.g. Sorare).\n\nAs the gaming landscape evolves, dominant blockbuster games will emerge from each sector. However, many games are currently under development and may take months or years to fully develop.\n\nMarketplaces\n\nAs games issue assets as NFTs, general marketplaces like OpenSea offer access as well as blockchain-specific marketplaces like Metaplex, VIVE, and Magic Eden that facilitate transactions. Further, some pieces of gaming infrastructure like Enjin offer their own marketplaces for Enjin SDK-developed games.\n\nLaunchpads\n\nLaunchpads effectively help upstart game developers raise capital for game development. Often these launchpads raise capital for a specific gaming ecosystem (i.e. Polkastarter for Polkadot) or Magic Eden for Solana). Typically, launchpads enable fundraising through either an initial DEX offering (IDO) or liquidity bootstrapping pool (LBP), each of which enables the initial sale of tokens.\n\nGaming Development Infrastructure\n\nGame development infrastructure like Forte and Enjin often have APIs and SDKs that enable game developers to quickly integrate NFTs or other crypto-economic activities. Building the entire blockchain infrastructure required for a game from scratch can be daunting and time-consuming for game developers. Just as blockchain developers leverage existing smart contract tooling and wallet infrastructure, game developers can leverage blockchain game development software (i.e. Stardust, Enjin, Forte) that supports modular components such as wallets, asset issuance, payments, and other foundational features.\n\nLayer-2 Infrastructure\n\nThe NFT bull market of 2021 resulted in increased investment from Layer-2s into the gaming ecosystem. Axie Infinity chose to vertically integrate, developing its own sidechain, Ronin, and its own DEX, Katana. Elsewhere game development platforms like Enjin have chosen to horizontally integrate, recently <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/a18131ee-379e-4dcd-8d04-b866b5fbd628\">securing</a> a Polkadot parachain auction for Efinity. Still, many existing games are committed to building on Ethereum’s existing network effects, leveraging Starkware (e.g. Sorare), ImmutableX (e.g. Gods Unchained), Polygon (e.g. Zed Run), and others for their scaling needs.\n\nLayer-1 Infrastructure\n\nLayer-1 infrastructure serves as the core foundation for various protocols and applications. While some games are building higher throughput blockchains like Solana and Flow, most Ethereum games have migrated to Layer-2 solutions. The importance of Layer-1s comes from the other composable protocols that games will leverage, including guilds, financialization protocols(e.g. NFTX), identity solutions (e.g. ENS), marketplaces, and other applications or services.\n\nGame Studios\n\nStudios sit at the base layer of the landscape since they are often developers of games as well as Layer-1 and Layer-2 infrastructure. Dapper, Sky Mavis, and Animoca Brands sit as the most well-capitalized game developers with hundreds of millions in capital. Ultimately, not every gaming studio will survive. However, those that develop the next blockbuster games have the potential to become the next Electronics Arts of the future.\n\nBlockchain Games Gain Interest\n\nThe first blockchain game was created in late 2017, but it wasn’t until the recent mainstream foray into NFTs that the subsector found substantial user engagement. With the popularity of games like Axie Infinity and mainstream collectibles like NBA Top Shot, blockchain-based games are now on the precipice of wider adoption.\n\nUser and Funding Metrics\n\nAlthough blockchain gamers comprise a small percentage of the three billion global gamers, recent data released by DappRadar shows October 2021 was the first month where over one million unique daily active wallets interacted with decentralized gaming apps. This number reflects an almost 300% increase from four months prior where the same metric showed only 350K wallet interactions.\n\nThe monthly unique number of NFT buyers of blockchain games is also on the rise. To date, most blockchain games require an individual to own NFTs which places an initial capital burden on gamers, much like purchasing a console. While this model remains the most popular today, it’s likely that more games will experiment with free-to-play models in the future.\n\nFollowing the Funding\n\nApart from wallets as an adoption proxy, another important metric to track is venture funding. Capital investments reflect many things: It reflects interest in the industry; it reflects, to some extent, the ambitions of founders in the space; and it reflects, to a greater degree, the resources at hand available to those challenging the status quo. It’s worth analyzing how the fundraising environment has changed this past year.\n\nNot surprisingly, the numbers continue to further highlight the growth of this subsector. Total venture funding across game titles and ecosystem infrastructure increased more than 100x compared to 2020. The jump still represents a roughly 40x increase from funding in 2018, the year in which funding was at its peak prior to 2021.\n\nVenture funding in 2021 came in such a stark contrast to previous years that multiple businesses raised rounds larger than the sum of all previous years combined. Examples include Forte, an end-to-end blockchain gaming development platform partnering with a host of gaming studios. Perhaps what’s notable about this data is the variety of products and services in this list: Both studios and infrastructure/tooling are represented, not to mention other components of the gaming stack including NFT marketplaces and various Layer-1 or Layer-2 blockchains.\n\nBeyond fundraising amounts, the origination of funding also shifted this past year. Crypto-specific venture funds were no longer the sole game in town. This past year, those who have made investments in the space now include traditional tech funds such as Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and Lightspeed Partners, as well as hedge funds with established track records in growth investing, notably Tiger Global and Coatue Management. On a go-forward basis, this triumvirate of players – particularly the fresh participants – should continue to bring new capital into the ecosystem.\n\nDeveloper Initiatives\n\nMoreover, a recent study of 157 developers in the United States and United Kingdom found 72% of those surveyed have considered integrating blockchain technology into their games, whereas 58% of the same group have plans to do so in the next 12 months. Meanwhile, 47% of participants are already using NFTs in their games, highlighting considerable interest from the developer side.\n\nWhile developers see an opportunity for new content, it should be reiterated that the technology behind such games remains nascent. Furthermore, current challenges around blockchain such as transaction costs, throughput speed, and general scalability limit gameplay mostly to turn-based, card-collecting games rather than the live-action and 3D graphics of AAA-rated games released by high budget studios.\n\nBlockchain Game Case Studies\n\nIn the following section, we’ll take a look at the growth of three recognizable blockchain games, their models, and what they mean for the blockchain gaming ecosystem.\n\nAxie Infinity  \nWidely recognized as the most popular game to date, Axie Infinity has facilitated over $3.5 billion in cumulative volume within its NFT marketplace. The premise of the game is similar to Pokemon. Players own and breed Axie champions, represented as tradeable NFT characters, who go on to either complete adventure levels or battle champions owned by computer opponents or other humans in the Axie Infinity realm.\n\nSuccessful battles or conquests lead to in-game rewards, which can be sold for real-world currency. Axie Infinity spawned the global adoption of the play-to-earn business model. It is estimated 40% of total players are from the Philippines alone, where gamers can earn upwards of $500 per month from playing. Gameplay revolves around two crypto tokens: Smooth Love Potions (SLP) tokens and Axie Infinity Shard (AXS) tokens.\n\nSLP Tokens: SLP tokens are more widely used for practical in-game purposes and grant holders the ability to breed new Axie champions. The process consists of burning SLP tokens to birth a new Axie creature. SLP tokens can be earned through regular gameplay, bought on secondary marketplaces, or engagement with promotional offers.\nAXS Tokens: AXS tokens are the governance token for the Axie Infinity game. Those who own AXS tokens can stake the token inside the network to earn yield. These tokens are also used as currency within the game’s NFT marketplace.\n\nAxie Infinity derives its protocol revenue from various fee mechanisms. The first such mechanism is marketplace fees earned as a percentage of sales facilitated through the NFT marketplace. The other main revenue stream comes from breeding fees paid by players to create new Axie creatures in the game. Two smaller revenue sources include fees earned from sales of in-game land and the original sale of first-generation Axie creatures.\n\nIn sum, the protocol has earned over $1.3bn in revenue from these four sources, with almost all of it occurring after June 2021. This timing coincides with Sky Mavis’s launch of the Ronin network, which helped decrease transaction costs for its users and boosted the game’s popularity.\n\nSegmentation of revenue seems to support this conclusion. Over 99% of total cumulative revenue is derived from activity on the Ronin network. Ethereum merely accounts for 0.19% of the $1.3bn while including revenue earned from land sales and first-generation Axie sales, both of which are not available on the Ronin network. Thus, Ronin’s 99%+ revenue claim is another indicator of the incredible activity from breeding and marketplace fees alone.\n\nThe graph below demonstrates just how much growth occurred in the second half of the year. Surprisingly, revenue begins to tail off in the last few weeks of 2021. Potential explanations for this include the recent Typhoon Rai wreaking havoc in the Philippines (where 40% of total users reside) or shifting interest towards blockchain games with newer gameplay.\n\nAlthough Axie Infinity's circulating market capitalization did fall in recent weeks as revenue growth slowed, a rough benchmark did find the game still comparable with many pure-play game studios. Notably, this methodology compares a singular game (Axie Infinity) with game studios that own multiple titles – further demonstrating how sizable this one blockchain game has become.\n\nAxie Infinity lags behind the largest industry players such as Nintendo, Activision Blizzard, and Electronic Arts – all of which have triple-A rated game studios – but much closer to several others. In the benchmark below, Axie Infinity has a similar circulating market cap as Ubisoft, the creator of famous games like Assassin's Creed and the Tom Clancy series.\n\nSorare  \nMuch like fantasy sports, Sorare offers its players the opportunity to blend real-world sports with digital games – only this time with the inclusion of blockchain technology. Think FIFA Ultimate Team with NFT cards as collectibles. Up to now, Sorare gameplay is limited to football (or soccer, in the United States) as the sport of choice, though the company recently raised $680 million in September to support its continued expansion.\n\nSorare tracks real-world football stats, rewarding players who own the NFT cards of high-performing athletes. Naturally the nature of the game draws a broad audience of football fans. As reflected above, first-time buyers of Sorare NFTs surged in the second half of 2021. The total unique monthly buyers of Sorare NFTs surpassed 20,000 for the first time in December 2021. Data presented here should be noted under a backdrop where, unlike Axie Infinity, gamers aren’t required to purchase NFTs to start playing. This likely means the total number of Sorare gamers exceeds those who made secondary NFT purchases.\n\nSorare is one of the most successful cases to date of NFTs merging with culture. The participation of influential football leagues, including some of the most popular in the world like the English Premier League, Spanish La Liga, and Europe’s top-tier Champions League, and willingness to lend their brand to a blockchain game, is a precursor for future games to come.\n\nDeFi Kingdoms  \nAnother blockchain game, DeFi Kingdoms, bears resemblance to a popular Internet classic, Runescape. Gamers of the latter may feel some nostalgia as virtual characters interact with one another within a retro pixel art world. Unlike Axie Infinity or Sorare, the gameplay of DeFi Kingdoms doesn’t revolve around collecting and battling with cards. Instead, the game incorporates heroes, quests, professions, and a broader array of actionable activities such as mining, gardening, farming, and fishing. The roadmap for the game is massively ambitious. Future gameplay will allow Heroes to join guilds, engage in peer-to-peer battles, hatch pets, and more. Having heroes participate in these various tasks boosts the gamer’s odds of accumulating resources tradeable on blockchain markets.\n\nDeFi Kingdoms, as its namesake suggests, blends elements of gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi), with a larger focus on the latter than many predecessors. The game includes a decentralized exchange, liquidity staking, and native NFT marketplace – all services found in the crypto ecosystem but not traditionally within a blockchain game. In fact, the team behind the game took a reverse approach to that taken by Axie Infinity; instead of starting with the game, DeFi Kingdoms began with traditional liquidity mining incentives and is growing the game out with time.\n\nThe selected blockchain running the game is Harmony. What’s notable about DeFi Kingdom’s launch on Harmony is the sheer dominance of the project across the blockchain network. DeFi Kingdom owns approximately 68% of all Total Value Locked (TVL), a significantly larger share than the two main DEXs active on the network, SushiSwap, and ViperSwap. A launch of DeFi Kingdoms on Avalanche is also expected to be released within the next few months.\n\nUsage data does seem to support the idea of the game gaining interest. Daily user count has continually trended upward since its launch. In early December, the game announced it would expand to Avalanche with the launch of a new realm called Crystalvale. On the date of the news, it was announced Avalanche DEXs such as Trader Joe and Pangolin would immediately begin providing liquidity for DeFi Kingdom’s new Avalanche-purposed in-game token; a few days later, the number of users active on Harmony jumped 64% before giving back some of those gains. Transaction volume also jumped 29% over the following two-week period.\n\nThe Metaverse\n\nOn a broader scale, much of what’s happening in gaming is moving in tandem with another major technology trend: the metaverse. Perhaps the metaverse has already touched your life – it wasn’t too long ago Facebook strategically rebranded itself as Meta – but if it hasn’t, odds are high it will over the next few years.\n\nDefining the metaverse is a little unclear in part because the concept itself remains largely hypothetical. At its base, the metaverse represents a collection of virtual worlds (including AR, VR, and two-dimensional) where we can engage with each other in a digital format. But as it stands today, multiple worlds simultaneously exist, the ecosystem is fragmented, and competition is fierce among those vying to lay the framework for which world applications ultimately get built on.\n\nRegardless of the metaverse’s final form, opportunities for in-game integrations are mostly unexplored. The metaverse widens the scope of gaming by unlocking new types of intellectual property, experiences, and behavior. One early example is Worldwide Webb, an interoperable massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). Worldwide Webb allows users to import owned NFTs into the game to serve as digital identities, which marks one of the first  \ninstances where NFT cross-application interoperability appeared in blockchain-enabled digital worlds.\n\nVirtual Worlds Dominance\n\nSince Decentraland’s ICO in August 2017, virtual worlds have long been discussed as a potential application within the metaverse. These virtual worlds are designed to be sandbox games (e.g. Minecraft, Roblox, etc.) where players can buy and build their own assets as well as socialize with other gamers.\n\nThe top four leading metaverse worlds are The Sandbox, Decentraland, Somnium Spaces, and Cryptovoxels. Each of these virtual worlds enables users to purchase scarce digital land and many of these also utilize their own in-game currency (e.g. The Sandbox’s Sand).\n\nTo date, some of these virtual worlds have gained notoriety for specific use cases. For instance, Cryptovoxels users have created 3D art studios and Decentraland hosts casinos and digital offices for various crypto companies.\n\nVirtual worlds have generated nearly $500 million in cumulative NFT sales (virtual land and in-game assets). In 2021, virtual world NFT sales witnessed the largest growth, generating over $320 million in NFT sales.\n\nThe Sandbox led virtual worlds by a large margin with over $235 million in sales. Moreover, Decentraland and The Sandbox both experienced 490% and 739% growth in NFT sales in Q4 alone, respectively.\n\nAs awareness of the metaverse increases, synchronous virtual worlds have experienced increased speculation. Ultimately, these applications are in their infancy, still building content for gamers and trying to find their niche among potential users (i.e. social, gaming).\n\nThe unique value proposition of blockchain networks – asset ownership, permissionless innovation, incentive design, and programmability – likely ensures that these protocols will support the metaverse as a foundational layer or as crucial parts of infrastructure for the secondary and tertiary applications and services.\n\nConclusion\n\nOver the past year, it’s undeniable that blockchain gaming experienced a watershed moment – a historical shift on which future development depends. The perception of blockchain gaming has changed because of successful games like Axie Infinity, the explosive growth of NFT secondary sales, and the broad growth of crypto adopters and more specifically the expansion of blockchain gaming users. In turn, this has catalyzed further funding into the blockchain gaming landscape across a variety of core pieces of infrastructure and dozens of new games and studios.\n\nThe tailwinds of the metaverse have also benefited the gaming industry, which makes up a significant portion of online activity today and will likely be an important area of growth and user acquisition for companies building in the metaverse.\n\nBlockchain ecosystems like Ethereum are developing at an increasing pace, but scaling challenges and user experience issues persist. Still, there are many teams developing solutions for both consumers and game developers to enhance the experience of building and playing blockchain games. Although a common monetization model across blockchain games has yet to emerge, the experiments around issuing NFTs, vertical marketplaces, in-game currencies, and other crypto-economic primitives remain promising.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Forte, a member of Messari Hub.

Notes this report only includes Sandbox Sales from OpenSea.\nThe number of active buyers rose ~37% compared to the last quarter and grew each quarter of 2021.\nThe Sandbox launched its limited Alpha version of its gameplay in November 2021 which drew thousands of players.\nThe most traded LANDs of The Sandbox virtual worlds are within the bottom left quadrant\n\nIntroduction to The Sandbox\n\nThe Sandbox is a gaming metaverse – virtual world – where players and creators can make 3D assets and experiences (e.g. games) that can be monetized via NFTs.\n\nThe Sandbox ecosystem leverages a variety of tokenized gaming features including:\n\nSAND – a digital in-game currency used for purchases, monetization, and asset creation\nLAND – digital ownable land within the Sandbox virtual world\nESTATE – a combination of LANDs to create a larger plot\nGAMES – a bundle of assets and scripting logic to create interactive experiences\nASSETS – 3D virtual images created by players\nGEMS – tokens burnt to give attributes to assets\nCATALYSTS – tokens burnt to create ASSETS\n\nThe Sandbox provides Mindcraft-esque gameplay with digital ownership and more robust in-game economics due to the tradeable nature of $SAND and the other assets within the Sandbox virtual world.\n\nSandbox offers a variety of in-game NFTs as well as user-generated NFTs. The VoxEdit NFT builder is used for creating 3D objects (ASSETS) such as avatars, creatures, buildings, and other tools.\n\nMacro Overview\n\nLANDS are blockchain-backed tokens (using the ERC-721 standard for non-fungible tokens, aka NFTs) representing physical parcels of The Sandbox Metaverse. There is a finite amount of Sandbox LAND – 166,464 parcels of which 62% have already been distributed.\n\nNew parcels are released for sale through auctions or at specific price points. In 2021, The Sandbox recorded over $350 million in LAND sales volume.\n\nNotably, 80% of The Sandbox's total LAND volume occurred in the final quarter with secondary sales making up for nearly all of fourth-quarter volume. While primary sales volume remained flat, secondary sales volume grew 1,685% compared to the prior quarter.\n\nSince The Sandbox had a player-capped Alpha release, tracking its active daily or monthly users isn’t useful at this point. However, the number of active buyers rose ~37% compared to the last quarter and grew each quarter of 2021.\n\nMore interestingly, the increase in secondary sales volume and growth in buyers resulted in a 25% turnover in the total LAND assets.\n\nWith 26,000 secondary LAND sales and around 15,000 unique buyers, it's likely that large owners are selling some of their LAND supply and that a subset of buyers are actively trading digital LAND.\n\nSandbox Micro Overview - Land Analysis\n\nThe median price of Sandbox LAND has appreciated from $1,308 at the end of Q3 to a median price of $11,364 by the end of Q4. This nearly 10x increase of the median price is due in part to the growing trend of the metaverse and Sandbox's continued expansion. Upon announcement of its Series B, Sandbox LAND appreciated significantly peaking in December.\n\nThe Sandbox LAND Map\n\nBy analyzing The Sandbox virtual world by total LAND volume per parcel, we’re able to determine which LANDs have been traded the most. Parcels in The Sandbox are separated into 1x1, 3x3, 6x6, 12x12, and 24x24 parcel plots. The heatmap shows the plots that have witnessed the highest aggregate trade volume on the secondary markets. This effectively helps determine which plots of LAND are most desirable (that have been available for sale).\n\nThe redder plots – indicating more trade volume – are predominantly clustered within the lower left quadrant of The Sandbox. One potential explanation is that as The Sandbox has expanded, traders have been drawn towards expanding regions of the map.\n\nDiving deeper, the reddest 12x12 plot is located (outlined in red) adjacent of the Yield Guild Games ESTATE and possesses multiple LANDS for sale on OpenSea (indicated by white boxes). It’s possible being close to YGG or Stakefish (the Doge dog ESTATE) makes the next-door land more valuable.\n\nThe second most speculated on plot (outlined in red) is near the first most traded 12x12 plot and shares a border with Atari, Ludena Protocol, and is close to two Sandbox-owned ESTATES. However, unlike the previous plot, this one has fewer OpenSea listings currently available.\n\nNotably, many of the largest ESTATES (24x24), especially within the center, have low aggregate trading volume. There are a few potential explanations for this effect. First, some potentially coveted parcels don’t trade often and many large ESTATES are owned by The Sandbox or their IP partners which are focused on building within the virtual world. Second, even the highest individual parcels have only sold for $100k-$245k which is below the heat maps second tier. Lastly, it’s possible that large owners don’t really care about making small profits on LAND and are looking to hold onto the LAND for a longer time period.\n\nInterestingly, the top 400 parcels by aggregate volume account for 32.5% of the total volume of the over 16,000 lands that have been traded at least once.\n\nThere is a clear concentration in the top 100 LANDs which account for nearly 17% of the total aggregate volume, showing that the top land within the Sandbox metaverse experiences significant volume.\n\nOne potential reason for this relatively high concentration of volume is that many LANDs haven’t entered the secondary market with the original owner hanging onto their parcels or ESTATES.\n\nThe Top LAND Owners\n\nThe top LAND owners are predominantly investors in The Sandbox (i.e. Binance, Galaxy Interactive, NFT communities (i.e. Whale, MetaKovan, Kongz), or large crypto-focused companies that have committed to building within The Sandbox Metaverse.\n\nThe top 5 LAND owners – one of which is The Sandbox – own 11% of the total LAND supply. Evaluating the percentage of ownership in a digital world is novel to ensure that 1) the amount owned by any one entity decreases over time, thereby facilitating greater in-world entrepreneurship and 2) monitoring that the LAND owners are actively building on their parcels as opposed to holding for speculative purposes.\n\nHigh Priced (Virtual) Real Estate\n\nIt’s worth noting that the Sandbox Heatmap above groups 12x12 parcels to see the total LAND volume and so the most speculated individual parcels of land (most aggregate volume) aren’t necessarily within the highest volume 12x12 grouping. The top five largest purchases – highest price paid for a single parcel of LAND – all exceed $100,000.\n\nCayson.eth, paid $245,000 for a single parcel of land. The buyer – who also owns BAYC 8435 – purchased the 35 surrounding plots for a total $547,119 ($15,632 per unit) and required the final parcel to create a 6x6 (36 plot) ESTATE.\n\nOlikars.eth holds the second, tenth, and fourteenth largest LAND purchases, spending a combined 80 ETH ($343,000) to acquire all three parcels. The account immediately transferred the assets to 0x2793999444f916254ea15b41403c111e9b610465 and then later to 0x64596df940be25aa5186b095c326dcca4660562d. One of the top purchased plots is adjacent to the future Walking Dead game. The other two plots are adjacent to the Atari RollerCoasterTycoon World and the Atari XL ESTATES.\n\nSandbox user Ksaffy – and BAYC #2765 owner – holds the title for the third largest plot transaction, purchasing a parcel near The Sandbox Central Hub where all players spawn into the game.\n\nThe fourth-largest transaction – $101,883 – was by Sandbox user CryptoSue for a single plot located adjacent to the Snoop Dog ESTATE and Weedbits plot. Finally, Club9.eth ranks fifth for the largest transaction purchasing plot 55816 for 24 ETH ($101,760) in November 2021 and later sold the same plot in January 2021 for 3.5 ETH for a significant loss. This same plot was sold again several days later for $4.67 ETH to an unknown wallet.\n\nAnecdotally, the top purchases are typically LAND owners trying to acquire specific plots of land whether that be next to ESTATES, user experiences (i.e. games, concerts), or important locations (e.g. near the spawn point) that the buyer likely believes will help drive traffic to their parcel.\n\nSandbox Ecosystem: Governance & Notable Events\n\nFundraising & Capital Expenditure\n\nThe Sandbox completed its $93 million Series B fundraising round in November led by Softbank. Sandbox has taken a distinct approach towards in-game content partnering with various brands and licensing intellectual property for dozens of companies. In a press release, The Sandbox state that the new capital will also be used to expand its IP licensing efforts and grow its virtual world.\n\nSubsequently, in December, The Sandbox completed a round with Hong Kong based entrepreneur Adrian Cheng to purchase an ESTATE of land within The Sandbox. The plot was purchased from The Sandbox’s “Mega City”, a location set to emulate Hong Kong with ownership across a variety of Hong Kong-based companies and prominent individuals.\n\nSandbox Alpha\n\nIn November of 2021, The Sandbox launched the long-awaited Alpha version of its virtual world which enabled users to interact with other players and explore the “Main Hub” of the Sandbox Universe. As part of the Sandbox Alpha, the Sandbox released 4 NFT avatar collections – Agora, Gearbox, Ducks, and Faction. The Sandbox Alpha was limited to 5,000 passes and had thousands of NFTs distributed to game players. As The Sandbox looks towards growing its user base, the next season of its Alpha is scheduled for May 1, 2022.\n\nPolygon Integration\n\nWhile Sand already maintains a liquidity pool on Uniswap with Ethereum gas fees making gaming on Ethereum’s base layer untenable, The Sandbox announced its intention to integrate with Polygon starting with an mSAND  MATIC staking pool on Quickswap. All Sandbox transactions incur a 5% fee, of which 2.5% is allocated to the various staking pools.\n\nSince there are a variety of transactions required interacting with The Sandbox virtual world (marketplaces, NFT creation, etc) Polygon will enable more interactions between tokens. The Sandbox and Polygon teams are currently working on a custom bridge to make all tokens within The Sandbox available on Polygon.\n\nThe SAND Foundation\n\nThe Sandbox team started the SAND Foundation to support the ecosystem and allocate grants to artists, game developers, and individuals who produce in-game content. Currently, all $SAND transactions incur a 2.5% transaction fee that is allocated to the Foundation Fund.\n\nLAND primary sales  – which accrue as revenue to The Sandbox (a subsidiary company of Animoca Brands – generated $12 million in Q4’21. Meanwhile, both The Sandbox company and The Sandbox Foundation take a 2.5% on secondary sales which resulted in $7 million in revenue in Q4 for each organization. Primary sales revenue will eventually end when all LAND is sold, making secondary sales royalty revenue (on LAND and ASSETS) a key revenue source for the SAND Foundation.\n\nRoadmap\n\nLooking ahead towards the first quarter of 2022, The Sandbox has a few notable developments.\n\nThe Sandbox DAO\n\nWhile not yet deployed, The Sandbox DAO will be able to vote on Foundation grants as well as make decisions on certain game parameters. The Sandbox DAO – set to launch in Q1 of 2022 – will be governed by both SAND token holders and asset owners (e.g. LAND).\n\nContinued LAND Distribution\n\nThe gradual distribution of LAND will continue through the first quarter of 2022. This will be coupled with more locations in The Sandbox Metaverse opening with various experiences available to players.\n\nLaunch of Public In-game Experiences\n\nIn-game experiences – activities for players – are core to growing The Sandbox userbase. Throughout the next two quarters, The Sandbox has planned a variety of experiences including virtual concerts – from LAND owners like Snoop Dogg and Deadmau5 – as well as the launch of games based on licensed intellectual property such as The Walking Dead.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nThe Sandbox recorded a record quarter in secondary LAND sales and Foundation revenue. Additionally, it expanded its total buyer base and released a substantial number of new LAND parcels for purchase on the open market. The Sandbox still remains fairly concentrated in LAND ownership, but with 38% of the total LAND parcels yet to be distributed The Sandbox will hopefully see expand its LAND ownership population as the company continues to gradually auction LANDs.\n\nMost importantly, The Sandbox launched its Alpha game to several thousand players along with a myriad of new NFTs including its own NFT avatar collection. As The Sandbox endeavors to create a virtual world populated with people and experiences, the team has various Q1 in-world events planned as well as the upcoming launch of The Sandbox DAO.\n\nThis report was commissioned by The Sandbox, a member of Messari Hub.

      "title": "Bundling and Unbundling, 1inch by 1inch",
      "content": "The following report was commissioned by 1inch, a member of <a href=\"https://messari.io/hub\">Messari Hub</a>. For additional information, please see the disclaimers following the article.\n\n“Gentlemen, there’s only two ways I know of to make money: bundling and unbundling.”\n\nJim Barksdale, formerly of Andreeson Horowitz\n\n  \nAggregating over 188 sources of liquidity across 7 supported blockchains, with volumes greater than 134 billion USD, and over 1.6 million users, few DeFi projects epitomize Barksdale’s famous proclamation as much as the 1inch Network. In December 2021, 1inch successfully raised 175 million USD in a Series B, valuing the network at around $2.25 billion, led by Amber Group. The raise is aimed at navigating the regulatory space in Europe and the US, building new 1inch protocols, expanding the utility of the 1INCH token and scaling up the contributor team.\n\nIn an increasingly fragmented DEX landscape with a wide array of chains, sidechains, rollups and their corresponding fee structures, liquidity and slippage, the 1inch aggregator offers a single interface that automatically finds the best price for a given trading pair across multiple sources of liquidity. But it is more than just a comparison shopping engine. The 1inch ecosystem is composed of:\n\nThe 1inch Wallet\nThe 1inch API\nThe 1inch Aggregation Protocol (DEX aggregator)\nThe 1inch Limit Order Protocol\nThe 1inch DAO\nThe 1inch Foundation\n\n2021 was a busy year for the 1inch Network, with a flurry of innovations aimed at improving the DeFi user experience. Let’s break it down.\n\nBundling DEXs for Fun and Profit\n\nAt the heart of the 1inch Aggregation Protocol is Pathfinder - a routing algorithm that finds the most efficient path for a token swap, splitting the transaction into multiple sub-transactions across different protocols and even different order depths within protocols to give you the best rate. The latest version of the protocol enhances an already long list of optimizations with a range of innovations.\n\nBeyond optimizing swap rates, Pathfinder can also reduce the probability of failed transactions thanks to its partial and dynamic fill mechanism. When a user submits a swap, Pathfinder first splits it between multiple liquidity sources. If during the process the rate on one protocol changes unfavorably, that particular branch of the route can be canceled, and only the favorable branches fulfilled. Further, dynamic fills will even allow the amount from the unfavorable branch to be redistributed across favorable branches, and the swap can be fully completed at the rate advertised in the interface. Users can also choose to optimize for the best rate or the lowest gas fee (up to 40%) - causing Pathfinder to modify its routing accordingly. All of these options can easily be toggled from the swap interface.\n\nWith code optimizations in the latest V3 version of the 1inch Aggregation Protocol, 1inch has become one of the most efficient decentralized swap solutions.\n\nSince late 2020, the protocol can also utilize collateral tokens in its routing, such as those minted on Aave and Compound. Such tokens need to be packed or unpacked to be used in a route - and this is done automatically by 1inch for the user, under the hood.\n\nBundling is one of the oldest business models on the internet, and the 1inch contributors team has demonstrated exceptional execution skills in building out their business. Few projects can claim the laundry list of both liquidity sources and optimizations that 1inch offers through its single interface, resulting in a healthy order flow across all the platforms 1inch operates on.\n\nUser growth has also been rapid, with returning users being roughly matched by new users month-on-month.\n\nUnbundling the 1inch AMM - Zero-Fee Limit Orders\n\n1inch also offers its own centralized swap offering with a zero-fee limit order functionality. Most AMMs today offer only market orders which means that once the user places the order, it is executed immediately at the available market price. A limit order is a standing order to execute a swap only when the market reaches a predetermined price or better - typically used by more advanced traders who are able to analyze the market and assess the probability of reaching the limit price.\n\nWhen a user places a limit order, it is added to a centralized database managed by 1inch. These orders can then be filled by any other user, including CEXs and the orders created by Pathfinder in the aggregation protocol. Takers of limit orders cover the gas costs in addition to the trade’s value, which means this is a zero-fee order for the user. The implementation also allows dynamic pricing, conditional offers where users set conditions for execution and Request for Quote (RFQ) offers for specific order sizes.\n\nThis functionality unlocks a host of features. Stop-loss orders, which automatically close when the price limit is reached, trailing stop orders, where the limit is set to ‘trail’ the market price by a fixed amount if it rises, and remain unchanged if the price drops, and auctions such as Maker DAO auctions where the price is dynamically set according to the best bids for a specific order size.\n\nThe version 2 of the 1inch Limit Order Protocol also facilitates gasless limit orders for ETH, enabling users with zero ETH balances to swap supported tokens. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for new/first-time users. Other improvements include DAI-like permits extended to more tokens, optimized RFQs and others.\n\nUnbundling specific functionalities (order types in AMMs) and building on them to offer a unique selling proposition is another tried-and-tested business model that 1inch has executed well on, with Ethereum volumes projected to cross 800 million in January 2022.\n\nUnbundling Liquidity with the 1inch Liquidity Protocol\n\nYou can earn tokens by participating in 1inch liquidity mining programs and locking LP tokens in pools. While this may seem like any generic AMM, 1inch has an innovation to offer here as well: virtual rates, which are a form of protection against ‘front-running’ attacks.\n\nFront-runners (miners or bots, primarily) observe transactions that are broadcast by a protocol, and insert their own transactions before they are finalized for profit. In AMMs, when a user swaps token A for token B, the amount of token B decreases in the pool compared to token A, becoming more expensive against A. A front-runner can exploit this to change the exchange rate before the user’s transaction by inserting a similar swap before the user in the next block. The two trades execute, and the price for B availed by the front runner is now guaranteed to be less than that after the user’s trade, as both trades successively increase the price of B. This allows them to then sell B back to the pool, with a profit in token A. Sandwiching ‘true’ swaps with such transactions repeatedly can result in large profits for front-runners. The user ends up with a higher rate for B since the front-runner pushed the price up by inserting their swap before the users trade.\n\nVirtual Rates discourage front-runners from such attacks on 1inch liquidity pools. Following a swap, the swap rate changes only for further swaps in the same direction. For swaps in the opposite direction following such a trade, the rate is a virtual rate that matches the previous swap, as opposed to reflecting the true rate dictated by relative volumes of the assets - preventing front-runners from driving the price up and then profiting from the reverse swap. The virtual rate is in effect for a ‘decay period’ following a successful swap, is governed by 1inch DAO participants, and can be set from 1 minute to 5 minutes through direct governance actions.\n\nThe 1inch DAO\n\n1INCH token holders can vote on protocol parameters and governance proposals by staking their 1INCH tokens in the governance protocol. The DAO is being implemented in two phases, the first of which kicked off in December 2020. In this phase, the 1inch Foundation distributed 1INCH tokens to community members through ‘incentivization activities’ according to a lockup release schedule. The initial, core community is expected to implement DAO-based governance in an efficient manner while the protocol governance process is stabilized.\n\nThe second phase is now underway, which will enable full-fledged control over extended governance mechanisms, and a treasury - as governed by this 1IP. Voting power is bestowed by holding st1INCH (non-transferable ERC-20 tokens representing 1INCH tokens staked in the protocol’s governance contract), and v1INCH (representing backer/advisors/core contributor 1INCH tokens locked in the vesting contract) which have 1/5th the voting power of st1INCH tokens. Both of these can delegate their voting weight to other addresses.\n\nCurrently, one address belonging to Binance has around 10% of the voting power, with the next highest being around 6%, as declared on the governance page.\n\nThis concentration of power is due to the 1INCH staking pool on Binance, and is not an individual whale holding 1INCH tokens. The 1inch team is waiting for community contributions and other categories to catch up with the core contributors and have a more even distribution - taking us to the next topic, the 1INCH token.  \n\nThe 1INCH Token\n\nThe 1INCH token has two uses: as a utility token, 1INCH is used in the liquidity protocol to achieve high efficiency routing. As a governance token, stakers of the token will be able to govern the protocol.\n\nThe 1inch community will hold 30% of the total supply of tokens, which means that after the vesting period, the majority of the voting power still lies in the hands of the core team, backers and investors. 8% of the 14.5% given to the Network Growth Fund was given to investors in the latest funding round.\n\nThe 1inch Foundation\n\nThe 1INCH token is issued by the 1inch Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to fostering the 1inch Network and community. It does so by engaging early adopters and growing the population of users staking 1INCH for governance, issuing grants to developers building on the 1inch protocols and yield farming initiatives designed to incentivize liquidity provision across the ecosystem.\n\nCompetition\n\n1inch is the dominant DEX aggregator on Ethereum, with more than $130 billion of volume. On both Ethereum and Polygon, 1inch is locked in a battle for supremacy with the 0x protocol (Matcha is the 0x aggregator Dapp).\n\nUltimately, this is a game of bundling execution, which will be won on the parameters of fees, liquidity, availability of trading pairs, and importantly, integration of other Dapps and Protocols. Within this design space, some tradeoffs are possible. Aggregation can happen not only at the DEX/Dapp level, but also the network level. Since the competitors are essentially aggregating the same DEX’s and Dapps across chains (at least eventually), this space is ripe for commoditization, with those attracting the most liquidity and offering the lowest fees winning out. Execution and speed of adoption and expansion will be the key drivers for success, and 1inch is well placed to remain dominant in this space for the time being.\n\nThe Way Forward\n\n1inch has demonstrated remarkable ability to extract capital efficiency out of the DEX ecosystem, and great execution both in terms of user acquisition as well as fund-raising. The rise of the alternate L1s, however, opens up a new horizon for growth, in two dimensions. The first is merely expanding the list of available DEXs and trading pairs. Indeed, 1inch has just expanded into the Avalanche and Gnosis chains in 2022. The other, more complex path is through cross chain swaps. One example is simply to incorporate multiple chains and L2’s within the pathfinding algorithm. Another example is cross-chain staking - where a user can buy a token through 1inch in one chain, and earn staking rewards from another. Technical concerns from Vitalik Buterin notwithstanding, the multi-chain universe represents a new frontier for 1inch to take their bundling and unbundling prowess to new heights.\n\n  \nThis report was commissioned by 1inch, a member of Messari Hub.

The Gaming sector, which has been one of the worst performers the past five weeks has finally set itself apart, bringing in the highest returns for the week with 26.94%. Even though the DeFi sector took the last spot, it brought an impressive 11.44% return.\n\nTop Assets\n\nTop Assets was the second best performing sector of the week with Ripple (XRP) leading the group, finishing the week with a massive 45.4% gain. The driver for XRP’s substantial outperformance compared to other assets in the sector could be attributed to positive sentiment related to the blockchain-based payments firm’s recent court case news. Avalanche (AVAX) took the second spot with a similarly impressive return of 31.0%. Unlike the top two performing assets of the sector, the rest of the assets traded with high synchrony and ended the week with returns ranging from 19.6% to 12.0%., Solana (SOL) was the laggard of the group.\n\nDeFi Assets\n\nAlthough DeFi was the least performing sector, it was by no means unimpressive. The sector saw a $7 billion influx of fresh TVL since last week, bouncing from the $200 billion support line. Thorchain’s RUNE was the best performer of the week, returning a 24.2% gain, closely followed by Aave (AAVE) with 23.0%. PancakeSwap performed the worst of the pack with a 4.2% return.\n\nSmart Contract Platforms\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) demonstrated resilience as most of the Smart Contract Platform assets experienced a mild drawdown mid week, AVAX continued its “up and to the right” trajectory allowing it to secure the top performer position for the week. The alternate Layer-1 assets returned a 31.0% gain on the week while the next best performer, Ethereum (ETH) was more than 10% away with a 19.5% return. Algorand returned 11.4% for the week, making it the least underperformer of the group.\n\nCurrencies\n\nAmongst the Currencies sector, Ripple (XRP) was the outperformer of the week by a large margin. While the rest of the assets were losing upward momentum, XRP managed to maintain its strength, breaking away from the pack mid week. It closed the week with a 45.4% return while the second spot was taken by Monero (XMR) with a 28.5% return. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bitcoin SV (BSV) performed the least in the group, with weekly returns of 15.6% and 12.8%, respectively.\n\nWeb3\n\nArweave (AR) was the Web3 sector leader for this week. The data storage protocol brought in a 23.5% return this week marking the first time the protocol claims the best performing asset of the sector since bringing back Weekly Recaps. Basic Attention Token (BAT) was on track to end the week as the worst performer but was able to regain territory allowing it to secure the second to last position with a 15.0%. Ultimately Stacks (STX) took the last spot with a 14.1% gain.\n\nGaming\n\nGaming had an impressive week, taking the spot as the top performing sector. Leading the pack with the highest return was Axie Infinity (AXS) which brought in a 36.0% gain. Next up was Chiliz (CHZ) returning 34.5% for the week. Out of the top 10 gaming assets by market capitalization, Yield Guild Games (YGG) was the only one not to finish the week with a 20%+ gain, returning 10.1%.\n\n",

      "title": "FRAX: A Fractional-Algorithmic Stablecoin",
      "content": "The following report was commissioned by FRAX, a member of <a href=\"https://messari.io/hub\">Messari Hub</a>. For additional information, please see the disclaimers following the article.\n\nMakerDAO created one of the first and arguably the most successful stablecoin, DAI (which is pegged to the USD 1:1). Maker’s DAI launched in 2017 and has been used throughout the DeFi ecosystem for lending, borrowing, and treasury reserves. DAI is created when collateral is placed into the Maker smart contract. To add a layer of stability, Maker requires that DAI is overcollateralized, but this also makes their stablecoin more capital inefficient. DAI, USDT, and USDC became some of the more prevalent stablecoins in the DeFi landscape throughout 2018-2020 as users and protocols leveraged these stablecoins to earn yield and expand their digital product offerings to users. USDC has inherent centralization risks since it’s reliant upon the USD and Maker’s DAI is heavily collateralized by USDC. Regardless, Maker’s DAI and usage attracted the attention of others in the industry as to the necessity and growth potential of stablecoins in the web3 ecosystem.\n\nUntil FRAX launched on Ethereum mainnet on 21 December 2020, stablecoins had either been fully backed by collateral (e.g. DAI) or entirely algorithmic (no collateral backing). Frax Finance was first announced in May 2019 (known then as Decentral Bank) as a fractional-algorithmic stablecoin protocol. The project was founded by Sam Kazemian, Jason Huan, and Travis Moore. Frax was created to be the “world’s first decentralized stablecoin with parts of its supply collateralized and parts algorithmic stabilized.”\n\nFrax is the first stablecoin protocol to implement design principles from both fully collateralized (e.g. Maker Protocol) and fully algorithmic stablecoins to create a new scalable, trustless, stable on-chain money (FRAX Docs). FRAX is pegged 1:1 to USD, which means it attempts to maintain 1 FRAX = 1 USD$.\n\nThe growth of FRAX has been impressive with massive adoption and system-wide traction occurring in Q4 2021 with the launch of Frax v2. As of January 25, the Frax treasury is earning an average of ~$500K income daily (~$180M annualized) through the AMOs, Algorithmic Market Operations Controllers, which the team launched in early Q4 2021. Additionally, the FRAX supply has climbed from under $500M FRAX to an incredible $2.6B FRAX in this same time period.\n\nUnderstanding Frax Protocol\n\nAt genesis, FRAX was 100% collateralized, meaning that minting FRAX only requires placing collateral into the minting contract. Today, Frax is operating in the fractional collateral phase, which means to mint FRAX requires placing the appropriate collateral and FXS into the Frax protocol. While the protocol is designed to accept any type of cryptocurrency as collateral, Frax will mainly accept on-chain stablecoins to keep volatility low so that FRAX can transition to higher algorithmic ratios smoothly. As FRAX gains traction and the system’s velocity increases, it could become easier and safer to include more volatile cryptocurrencies such as ETH and wrapped BTC into future pools.\n\nThe Frax protocol implements a two token system design: a stablecoin, FRAX, and a governance token, FXS. The two token system allows for FRAX to be backed by both collateral and an algorithm (burning and redeeming of FXS). FRAX is minted when collateral and FXS are deposited into the Frax protocol contract. The amount of collateral needed to be deposited to mint 1 FRAX is determined by the collateralization ratio. The Frax collateralization ratio determines the ratio between collateral and algorithm that makes up the $1 FRAX value.\n\nFor example, let’s assume the collateralization ratio is 80%. This means that 80% of 1 FRAX is backed by collateral, like USDC, and 20% is backed by the algorithm that manages FXS supply. For both minting and redemption purposes, the protocol obeys the collateralization ratio, guaranteeing that 1 FRAX is backed by $1 of value.\n\nPeg stability is a crucial component for any stablecoin. FRAX maintains its USD 1:1 peg through deep liquidity pools. One such pool, also the largest liquidity pool, is on Curve Finance in FRAX3CRV. As of writing, the FRAX3CRV pool holds approximately 1.3B FRAX and this deep FRAX liquidity enables FRAX to be traded and swapped for other stablecoins with low or no slippage. The Curve AMO, implemented as part of Frax v2, furthers the stability of FRAX by automatically supplying excess collateral plus FRAX from the Frax protocol to the FRAX3CRV pool to ensure this deep liquidity remains (more on this below in the AMO section).\n\nThe price of FRAX, FXS, and collateral are calculated using a time-weighted average of the Uniswap pair price and the ETH:USD Chainlink oracle. The Chainlink oracle allows the protocol to get the true price of USD instead of an average of stablecoin pools on Uniswap. This allows FRAX to stay stable against the dollar itself which would provide greater resiliency instead of using a weighted average of existing stablecoins only.\n\nFrax is an agnostic protocol and allows the market to determine the collateralization ratio that it will settle on long term. The Frax protocol does not make any assumptions about what collateralization ratio the market will tolerate. Instead, Frax allows for the ratio to fluctuate and the market determines what collateral ratio the market prices FRAX at $1.\n\nTokenomics and Value Accrual\n\nThe FXS supply has been initially set to 100 million tokens at genesis. As more FRAX is used in DeFi ecosystems, this drives value to the FXS holders because minting FRAX requires burning FXS (thus decreasing FXS supply, and increasing value to FXS holders). As the value of FXS goes up, the price stability of FRAX increases creating a positive feedback loop for all those who are lending or borrowing FRAX to do DeFi or other digital economic transactions.\n\nFrax Finance also allows investors to become liquidity providers by bonding FRAX/FXS or FXS/ETH on Uniswap, which generates fee revenue for the liquidity providers on trades and swaps.\n\nThe protocol has also implemented the vote escrowed (ve) governance token model. This model is generally analogous to the well known veCRV framework, with slight variations for the Frax protocol (more on this below). In addition, Frax has developed a unique protocol feature called algorithmic market operations modules, or AMO. These are discussed in further detail below, but this mechanism further drives value back to holders of FXS.\n\nPerformance upgrades: veFXS and Frax v2 AMOs\n\nveFXS and cvxFXS\n\nShortly after the project launched in 2020, FXS holders were allowed to lock up their FXS tokens to generate veFXS (voting escrow FXS) and earn special boost, governance rights, and AMO (Algorithmic Market Operations Controller) profits. The vote escrow, or “ve”, mechanism has been popular across several DeFi protocols. FXS holders are eligible to lockup their FXS tokens for up to four years. The longer the FXS tokens are locked, the more bonuses awarded to the veFXS holders. It should be noted that the veFXS tokens are non-transferable.\n\nAdditionally, veFXS holders are also able to participate in Frax gauges and influencing or directing FXS to different FRAX gauges - a similar mechanism that was established by the Curve protocol and it’s gauge system. veFXS holders are eligible to direct FXS to one or multiple Frax gauges of their choosing. Once all of the FXS has been emitted, the gauges will turn to managing FRAX stablecoin expansion to continue to reward liquidity providers.\n\nRecently, Convex has partnered with Frax protocol to further align the two protocols' incentive programs, specifically around locking veFXS into the CVX protocol. Before diving into this partnership, it’s important to understand Convex’ place in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nConvex was launched in May 2021 as a platform intended to boost CRV rewards and simplify staking CRV for liquidity providers and stakers by creating an access point to CRV benefits through its native CVX token. Thus, as soon as Convex was launched it began actively acquiring the CRV and veCRV tokens. By early summer 2021, it became the largest holder of veCRV tokens in what’s been dubbed the Curve Wars. Curve Finance rewards liquidity providers with CRV tokens, which allows governance rights on which protocols’ pools are funded with CRV rewards and fee sharing. By the end of 2021, Convex Finance has solidified its lead role as the main shareholder of Curve governance.\n\nWith Convex as the main holder of veCRV tokens, DeFi protocols have begun to acquire and partner with Convex as a way to access the governance rights and benefits allocated to veCRV holders (recall veCRV holders dictate which Curve pools are rewarded with CRV emissions every 10 days).\n\nBack to Frax and Convex. Frax holds 19% of CVX giving them substantial governance power in the Convex protocol, which can be thought of as a proxy for veCRV governance power and directing future CRV rewards.\n\nThe Frax and Convex partnership comes with added benefits to the veFXS holders. veFXS holders are able to lock their veCVX into the Convex protocol in return for cvxFXS. This deposited veFXS will be irreversible and locked forever. All cvxFXS holders will be rewarded with a future FPI (Frax Price Index) token airdrop. In the future, cvxFXS/FXS bonding pair will be created so that protocols and users may exit their cvxFXS position. As of writing, cvxFXS staking and rewards are still being developed and are not finalized yet.\n\nFrax v2: AMOs\n\nFrax v2 launched the algorithmic market operations modules, or AMO. An AMO creates smoother operations for Frax by automating the movement of FRAX and its collateral across the DeFi ecosystem. The Frax AMOs further enable FRAX growth by leveraging Frax’s assets in a capital efficient way by programmatically moving collateral and/or FRAX to capital efficient locations depending on the collateral ratio. Frax has implemented several key AMOs: FXS 1559, Collateral Investor, Curve AMO, Uniswap v3, and FRAX lending.\n\nFXS1559 is an in-protocol rule that all AMOs must utilize. FXS1559 calculates all excess value in the Frax system above the collateral ratio and uses this value to buy FXS for burning. Until October 2021, FXS1559 stated that 50% of value would be used to buy then burn FXS (creating value for FXS holders by decreasing supply) and 50% was given directly to veFXS holders. In October 2021, Frax passed a <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/d8780def-fcb1-404e-a570-e12ba26a5610\">proposal</a> to give 100% of AMO revenues and profits to veFXS holders. This change further incentives FXS holders to lock their FXS in the Frax protocol as veFXS rather than hold FXS.\n\nThe Collateral Investor AMO puts idle USDC collateral from the Frax treasury to work across several DeFi protocols such as Aave, Compound, and Yearn. This AMO will loan out or reclaim collateral automatically as the collateral ratio changes. As the collateral ratio lowers and more of FRAX is backed algorithmically, the Collateral Investor AMO will automatically send collateral to the aforementioned protocols to generate additional yield on its USDC for veFXS holders. If the collateral ratio rises and more collateral is required to back FRAX, the Collateral Investor AMO will work in reverse and pull collateral back to the Frax treasury in accordance with the collateral ratio that the market deems necessary to keep confidence in Frax. Since implementation, the Collateral Investor has accrued $63.4M profits for veFXS holders.\n\nThe Curve AMO moves idle USDC collateral and/or new FRAX to the FRAX3CRV Curvel pool to create more liquidity and tighten the FRAX peg. The FRAX3CRV pool will earn Curve trading fees, CRV, and other LP rewards (by loaning out the CRV LPs to Yearn, StakeDAO, and Convex). The trading fees and LP rewards will be used to reward veFXS holders, while the CRV rewards will be used to boost the FRAX3CRV pool rewards. Similar to the Collateral Investor AMO, as the collateral ratio changes, FRAX then USDC will be added (collateral ratio lowers) or removed (collateral ratio rises) from the FRAX3CRV pool to make sure that FRAX is appropriately backed by the right percentage of collateral within the FRAX treasury.\n\nThe Uniswap v3 AMO (or Liquidity AMO) puts FRAX and idle collateral to work by providing liquidity Uniswap v3. This provides liquidity for other stablecoins to be traded and swapped for FRAX. Since the AMO is able enter any position on Uniswap v3 and mint FRAX against it, the Uniswap v3 AMO allows for expansion to other stablecoins and later more volatile collateral that is on Uniswap v3. The trading fees generated from the liquidity provided are brought back to reward veFXS holders. As with the other AMOs, as the collateral ratio changes, FRAX and collateral can be added or withdrawn from it’s LP position on Uniswap v3.\n\nThe FRAX Lending AMO allows for FRAX to be minted into money markets such as Aave to allow anyone to borrow FRAX by paying interest instead of the base minting mechanism. The collateral provided in these protocols treasuries would back the FRAX minted. The mechanism used here is very similar to Maker’s D3M feature, where DAI supply is expanded/contracted from a lending market based on the current borrowing demand. This AMO creates risk as FRAX is backed by collateral held by other protocols, but the protocol is able to moderate this risk by controlling the amount allowed to be minted directly into money markets.\n\nOf these AMOs, Collateral Investor AMO brings in the majority of the profits for Frax Finance. As seen in the graph below, the Collateral Investor has accrued profits worth ~$75M since being implemented in October 2021.\n\nCurrently, there are other AMOs in the works, such as Collateral Hedge and a Tornado Cash integration. These too will follow the same principles that all AMOs comply with. AMOs will likely continue to be proposed and implemented as FRAX is expanded and leveraged as a stablecoin in more DeFi protocols.\n\nMarket Overview\n\nFrax Finance operates in the stablecoin market, which has largely been dominated by fiat-backed stablecoins such as USDC and USDT. Algorithmic flavors of stablecoins have recently seen tremendous growth, specifically FRAX whose market cap has grown nearly 530% since October 2021. This trend will likely continue as the wider ecosystem seeks liquidity to match its overall growth, and algorithmic stablecoins such as FRAX can leverage their capital efficient AMOs to fill this gap.\n\nHowever, FRAX is not the only algorithmic stablecoin seeking to expand it’s supply in the ecosystem and DeFi space. Stablecoins like FEI and UST have both seen rapid growth as of late, with UST hovering around $10.6B in market cap and FEI seeing ~50% growth in its market cap over the past quarter (Q4 2021). Developments and growth are happening at a breakneck pace in stablecoins. One example would be the Fei and Rari protocols merger. With this merger, Fei will look to capitalize on integrating its stablecoin FEI further into DeFi by leveraging Rari’s lending markets.\n\nIt’s unlikely the market has reached a state of winner-take-all dynamics regarding algorithmic stablecoins. Frax and other similar stablecoin protocols will likely continue to grow together as the overall stablecoin market and DeFi products grow. From a systemic perspective, FRAX has done a remarkable job holding its peg, and exhibiting the powerful efficiencies of an algorithmic stablecoin. Now that supply has grown and deep FRAX liquidity exists, it would seemingly require a catastrophic (ecosystem-wide) event to destabilize it. This risk exists for FRAX as well as the other, robust stablecoins.\n\nRoadmap and other partnerships\n\nThe multichain universe\n\nFrax is built to be interoperable across all chains. There is not an independent Frax implementation for each chain. For this reason, the protocol has a bridging system that allows it to maintain a tight peg and fungibility. Importantly, the AMO functions and FRAX gauges can be deployed across different chains, allowing for FRAX expansion into new and growing markets and chains.\n\nAs stated by the Frax team: “The Frax Protocol is a multichain protocol with global state consistent across all deployments. FRAX + FXS tokens are a single distribution across all networks.” Each blockchain has one canonical FRAX and one canonical FXS contract that are referred to as \"FRAX'' and \"FXS\". These tokens are what AMOs expand or contract and users can mint or redeem.\n\nFPI: Frax Price Index token\n\nOn 1 January 2022, Sam tweeted that the Frax team has been and is working on the Frax Price Index ($FPI). This would enable decentralized applications to reference $FPI as an algostable peg. Not much has been said or revealed yet, however, cvxFXS holders will be rewarded a FPI airdrop.\n\nOther recent partnerships: OlympusDAO & Ondo Finance\n\nThere have been other partnerships, such as a token swap between OlympusDAO and Frax Finance (OHM  FRAX) to “further incentivize team] collaboration.” The OlympusDAO team has been actively building a treasury filled with DeFi tokens and stablecoins, which can be bonded to their OHM token. This has allowed OlympusDAO to create an entire marketplace for [protocol owned liquidity.\n\nAnother recent partnership is between Ondo Finance and Frax Finance. This partnership aims to create a product that Ondo will market and sell called “Frax-as-a-Service” or FaaS. The idea is that a new protocol will be able to deposit their native token into an Ondo vault and Frax and Ondo will match the protocol’s deposited amount with equal amounts of FRAX, creating a liquidity pair. This enables the protocol to immediately have liquidity for their token for users and protocols to onboard and offboard without needing to set up liquidity mining programs. As a participating party, Frax Finance will receive 5% APR on the liquidity it provides.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrax allows for the market to determine the collateralization ratio that it is comfortable with for $1 FRAX. As demand for FRAX increases, the veFXS holders will benefit as rewards and profits from the AMOs implemented to leverage idle collateral. While there are risks with FRAX and any token within the web3 finance space to consider, the Frax protocol experiment, a fractional-algorithmic stablecoin, has proven incredibly exciting and innovative.\n\nHaving multiple stablecoins (DAI, FRAX, MIM, UST, etc.) with different designs is a value-add to the crypto and web3 ecosystem as it derisks the blockchain ecosystems. FRAX and FXS are built with a long-term mindset and vision to have FRAX integrating into critical DeFi protocols. The novel fractional-algorithmic stablecoin design of FRAX allows for capital efficient stablecoin creation and allocation, and as the overall market continues expansion, FRAX should be well positioned to further this growth.\n\nThis report was commissioned by FRAX, a member of Messari Hub.

      "content": "This report was originally published as a Messari Pro research article on 11/01/2021 but is now unlocked as a free report on behalf of Yearn Finance. If you are interested in unlocking Messari Pro or Enterprise research reports please reach out to hub@messari.io.\n\nWe all know Yearn. It’s the set-it-and-forget-it yield aggregator running on top of DeFi’s yield-generating protocols like Compound, Aave, Curve, and Convex. Users can passively earn with the click of a button. Within Yearn’s Vaults, strategists continually compete to write the top yield-earning strategies as they are rewarded 50% of the revenue. Over time, the protocol has become synonymous with yield and has garnered an industry reputation as a leading risk-minimized yield source.\n\nBut what do we not know about Yearn? What’s under the covers? Sure it’s grown 11x in terms of TVL since the start of 2021, but where is this growth coming from? It’s an important question to understand as a token investment is, in traditional theory, valued at nothing more than the discounted value of future cash flows. And future growth is defined at the margin - so who is the marginal depositor for Yearn?\n\nYearn’s Anatomy\n\nLet’s first break down Yearn’s multiple products.\n\nVaults: The flagship protocol used by the majority of users, Vaults account for 67% of Yearn’s TVL. Users deposit into a vault which is defined per asset and the underlying yield strategies are executed to deploy the capital. As the first iteration, V1 vaults were limited to single strategies and have since been deprecated. V2 launched at the turn of the year and offers more complex yield aggregation as vaults can be powered by multiple yield strategies.\nEarn: Similar in nature to vaults but even more simple. It originally focused on stable assets which users could deposit and underneath the assets are shifted between money market protocols depending on which offers the highest yield.\nIron Bank (IB): IB is a money market protocol focused on servicing users and protocols. Users are able to deposit approved assets as collateral to earn yield from borrowers or borrow other assets themselves. Protocol users can be whitelisted in order to facilitate under-collateralized borrowing.\nSpecial: This is a catch-all for non-core businesses. It accounts for yGov and yveCurve TVL.\n\nTVL grew significantly from March through May adding over $4B in TVL. Of the new TVL, 68% or $2.8B came from the new V2 Vaults - by far the majority. However, since May, the V2 vaults have been largely flat up until mid-September where Vault TVL again began its upward climb growing over 31% into mid-October.\n\nHere we have two distinct periods of growth in the V2 vaults. One at the beginning of the year from roughly March through May, and another recent move starting in mid-September. As anyone in crypto can surely tell you, these two periods are both times of significant price appreciation in ETH and BTC; begging the question - is this growth due to organic, new deposits or simply underlying price appreciation?\n\nYearn has distinct vaults for each asset it supports. 7 vaults hold over $100M in deposits and account for over 76% of the V2 vault TVL. Assets supported in these vaults include the top stablecoins like USDC, DAI, USDT, and the top market cap tokens ETH and staked ETH as well as WBTC. Splitting these vaults out between stable assets and volatile assets and focusing on the raw token counts shows where deposits are organically increasing irrespective of price.\n\nLooking at the first phase of V2 growth from March to June, both deposits of stablecoins and volatile assets increased significantly. Stables grew nearly 5x during this time and added nearly $1B in new TVL. ETH and stETH (yvCurve-stETH) deposits grew nearly 3x and added $400k in new TVL.\n\nThe second period of growth is noticeably different. Stablecoin token counts in vaults actually declined from mid-September to mid-October while there has been a sharp increase in new token deposits in the ETH denominated vaults - particularly the yvCurve-stETH vault. Over $670M (170k ETH) has been added to the stETH vault between September 15th and October 15th. 6x growth in 30 days.\n\nBreaking out TVL across the top V2 vaults (vaults over $100M in TVL which collectively account for over 76% of the V2 TVL), the recent growth period trend is clear. USDC TVL has decreased 9% over the last 90 days. DAI has modestly increased 2%. ETH and stETH TVL, however, are up over 118% and 109%, respectively, across the same timeframe.\n\nSo there we have it. Two distinct periods of growth for Yearn V2 vaults with different underlying drivers - Phase 1 was heavily influenced by stablecoin deposits while Phase 2 was exclusively ETH and stETH driven. However, despite differences in sources of growth, both phases share one distinctive quality - the sharpness of the growth.\n\nStablecoin deposits went nearly vertical across April. stETH and ETH have been doing the same since mid-September. With such concentrated, rapid growth drivers, another question is raised - are numerous new depositors coming in, or is this the result of a few, large depositors?\n\nTo understand the wealth distribution in the top V2 vaults, various cohorts of depositors are broken out into buckets by how much TVL is deposited from the unique address. For example, depositors contributing between $1 and $100k is one bucket, between $100k and $500k another, $500k to $1M, and so forth. Doing so reveals a distinct relationship between the types of depositors Yearn has in its V2 vaults: wealth concentration.\n\nDespite having over 6,220 active depositors in the top V2 vaults, $2.0B or 76% of the top V2 vault TVL comes from the 30 addresses depositing over $10M. $10M being deposited from a single address isn’t neighbor-nextdoor money, it’s protocol money.\n\n$1.5B or 57% of all the TVL in the top seven V2 Vaults come from 18 identified partner protocol integrations. External protocol partners are directing significant TVL towards Yearn’s vaults in order to repurpose the generated yield as a design component in their protocols.\n\nAlchemix is the largest Yearn depositor contributing nearly $600M in TVL across the yvDAI and yvWETH vaults. Alone it contributes over 76% of the DAI TVL and 44% of the yvWETH TVL.<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/alchemix-bringing-future-yields-to-the-present\">Alchemix</a> protocol takes collateral deposits which are by and large deposited into Yearn’s yield bearing vaults. Yield generated on this collateral is automatically applied as payments to a user’s outstanding loan debt in Alchemix.\n\nSushi’s BentoBox is the second-largest protocol contributor with over $583M deposited across the yvUSDC, yvUSDT, yvWETH, and yvCurve-stETH vaults. BentoBox is a protocol under the Sushi umbrella that acts as a base-layer protocol for other protocols to build on top of. Its key feature is to allocate idle deposits towards yield-bearing strategies - one of which is Yearn Vaults. BentoBox is the largest depositor in the yvUSDC vault, contributes a third of the yvWETH TVL, and nearly half of the $674M TVL in the yvCurve-stETH. The ETH and stETH deposits are most notable as they can be largely tied to one meteoric protocol building on top of the BentoBox app Kashi - Abracadabra. Both yvWETH and yvSTETH are two of the top three collateral assets utilized in Abracadabra to back its stablecoin, MIM.\n\nIn fact, Abracadabra (via Sushi’s BentoBox) and Alchemix play significant parts in the two phases of growth identified previously. Alchemix, initially launched in March with its DAI vault, is largely responsible for the massive expansion of DAI in Yearn during the first period of growth. Abracadabra has increased its TVL by 5x from mid-September and is the driving factor for the second phase of Yearn’s growth which is largely made up of new deposits of stETH and ETH.\n\nAnother linkage between these two protocols is their association with the<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/beyond-defi-2-0-what-is-driving-defi-s-current-innovation\">DeFi 2.0 </a>narrative. It’s important to understand the mechanisms driving this narrative in order to understand how Yearn is growing its influence across the ecosystem.\n\nOutside of the protocol-controlled value (PCV) features, protocols that are commonly associated with the DeFi 2.0 narrative largely utilize Yearn’s yield-bearing vault tokens (yvTokens) as a design aspect to make existing processes more efficient. Abracadabra uses yield-bearing assets to back collateralized debt positions. Alchemix uses Yearn yield to self-repay loans. Frax uses Yearn yield to collateralize its stablecoin. Ribbon uses Yearn yvUSDC as collateral to sell structured option strategies against.\n\nYearn has effectively grown out of being the peoples’ yield aggregator and moved into the role of being the dominant yield partner for other protocols. One could argue Yearn has found the bulk of its growth and product-market-fit as a Yield-as-a-Service protocol (B2B), not as an end-user protocol (B2C).\n\nThis isn’t entirely without design. Back in March, prior to the first growth phase, Yearn announced the Yearnpartnership program in which protocol partners who contribute capital to Yearn vaults can earn back half of the revenue generated (after the strategist 50% revenue).\n\nSuccess with the partnership program comes down to how Yearn is positioned in the ecosystem. Yearn is able to offer a single, trusted integration point to other protocols for yield so that time is not wasted and integration risk is not introduced managing and maintaining strategies themselves. It serves as a capital allocation protocol fully at the disposal of users and protocols alike. However, Yearn differs in the magnitude of the value provided to the two different parties which is manifested in the sources of Yearn’s growth figures. To users, Yearn and its yield is the end goal. To protocols, yield is a means to an end, a tool utilized in the creation of a new product - something that creates additional value and efficiency.\n\nThe Next Phase\n\nWhere Yearn grows from here is largely dependent on its V3 UI, multi-chain strategy, and the defensibility of its position.\n\nYearn’s V3 UI was recently released as a beta in September and introduced a number of key changes focused on improving user experience, scalability, multi-chain adoption, and B2B integrations. The bulk of the updates in the V3 UI are on its back-end architecture. A new SDK is introduced which simplifies data aggregation of on-chain and off-chain data within Yearn. It simplifies the integration process for not just Yearn, but also its partners.\n\nMultichain is a huge benefactor of the new V3 UI architecture. Now architecturally feasible in the back-end, Yearn was able to announce in early October it would be deploying on Fantom followed by numerous other EVM chains (provided they have safe, dependable yield sources).\n\nSo far Yearn has been able to defend its position in DeFi as the dominant yield aggregator. This is evidenced by its ability to command an industry-leading 2/20 fee model which has generated the fourth largest DeFi protocol revenue in the last 180 days without any liquidity incentives.\n\nMaintaining its dominant Ethereum position while expanding into leading positions across ecosystems with potentially new yield sources, new protocols partners, and new competitors will be the next question to address for the protocol.",

      "content": "The following report was commissioned by Allbridge, a member of <a href=\"https://messari.io/hub\">Messari Hub</a>. For additional information, please see the disclaimers following the article.\n\nScaling and interoperability solutions are the core plumbing of the crypto industry. Today, there are over 100 active public blockchains. Bridges are essential to enable the transfer of assets and information between one chain and another. But before diving into blockchain bridges, why should blockchains be interoperable in the first place? Reviewing some Economics 101 may help clarify.\n\nConsider a simple world of two economies, Belgium and France, that only produce beer and wine, respectively. It is common knowledge that France is better at producing wine than Belgium. The country has the production facilities, labor, expertise, and climate - though the latter might change with global warming. Relative to beer country Belgium, it is not hard to imagine it costs France more to produce beer. In this simple model, both countries specialize in producing one good.\n\nIn reality, the French (usually) don’t only want to drink wine. In the absence of trade, they are happy to give up some production of wine to produce beer. The problem is that it would be much more efficient if France could export its excess wine and import beer from Belgium. The same reasoning holds for Belgium as a specialized producer of beer. The optimum is evident: both economies can enjoy more goods for the same amount of resources by engaging in trade.\n\nTrade theory shows us that every economy benefits from trade one way or the other. The same train of thought can be applied to blockchain ecosystems. Blockchains also specialize in unique use cases, target audiences, and geographies. The most critical differences follow from the scalability trilemma coined by Vitalik Buterin. All networks have to make a trade-off between being fully decentralized, secure, or scalable. For example, Ethereum prioritizes decentralization and security over scalability. Solana, on the other hand, optimizes performance at the cost of decentralization. In this example, trade theory shows us we should run compute-intensive applications such as derivatives on Solana and process critical transactions on Ethereum. That is if these blockchains can “trade” information with each other.\n\nThe scalability trilemma is exactly why alternative smart contract platforms gained so much traction in 2021. Instead of maximizing Ethereum, users jumped over to different networks for different applications. Over the last year, total value locked (TVL) increased from $18 billion to just shy of $250 billion across Layer-1s and scaling solutions. As the market continues to grow, Ethereum’s dominance may slowly deteriorate over time. Today, Ethereum controls roughly 60% of total assets locked in smart contract platforms. That’s a 30% decline from August 2020 - a clear signal that crypto is moving towards a multi-chain world.\n\nAll of these new blockchains need to talk with each other instead of competing in silos, and effective cross-chain connectors are necessary to induce communication across chains. The need for cross-chain communication is where bridges enter the scene. They open up a whole new playing field: they enable users to access new platforms with their assets, protocols to interoperate with each other, and developers to build out new features and products. There is an incredible opportunity in bridging infrastructure, and Allbridge is laying the foundation.\n\nAllbridge\n\nLaunched in July 2021, Allbridge is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain bridge with on-chain consensus. The platform provides a simple and reliable way to transfer tokens between various networks. Allbridge is backed by APYSwap Foundation and initially focused on bridging Solana with other chains. It was therefore originally called Solbridge. Realizing it could use its expertise to bridge any network, the project rebranded to Allbridge. The team now aspires to create a decentralized multi-chain hub for bridging assets. To fund these ambitions, Allbridge launched its token ABR on the Boca Chica and Smartpad launchpads in September 2021. The project also recently underwent a rebranding to improve user experience and cater to a broader audience.\n\nSource: Allbridge App\n\nAllbridge bridges tokens across Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Layer-2, and non-EVM compatible blockchains and plans to support NFTs in the future. The protocol uses a modular architecture to integrate additional chains more efficiently. The result: the bridge was able to support 47 assets across Ethereum, BSC, Solana, Polygon, Avalanche, and six other networks in seven months. Aurora and Harmony are the latest blockchains to be supported on the platform.\n\nA total of $5 billion has been bridged on the platform to date - a 117% increase from the $2.3 billion bridged in October. In December, $231,000 in fees were collected on the platform, and on average, 2,900 transfers were made on Allbridge every day. Solana is the most active network with a 44% share in fees collected. At the time of writing, close to $380 million in assets are locked in its liquidity pools. Those are healthy numbers for any seven-month-old protocol, and clearly, there’s a significant opportunity left as Allbridge continues to integrate new blockchains and tokens.\n\nHow Is Allbridge Built?\n\nAllbridge has a very intuitive platform for users. Users connect their wallets and execute a send transaction on source blockchain A and a receive transaction on destination blockchain B. The transfer only takes as long as it takes to transact on the two blockchains. This means that the transfer can be completed almost instantly if the confirmation speed is fast enough.\n\nSource: Documentation\n\nBehind this simple user experience lies an innovative protocol design. Users can make four different transfers on Allbridge:\n\nSend native tokens and receive native tokens: Native tokens are locked on blockchain A and unlocked on blockchain B. This works similar to a DEX with two liquidity pools facilitating a swap.\nSend native tokens and receive wrapped tokens: Native tokens are locked in the liquidity pool on blockchain A, and wrapped tokens are minted on blockchain B.\nSend wrapped tokens and receive native tokens: Wrapped tokens are burned on blockchain A, and native tokens are unlocked from the liquidity pool on blockchain B.\nSend wrapped tokens and receive wrapped tokens: Wrapped tokens are burned on blockchain A, and minted on blockchain B.\n\nTransfers are completed by a series of requests between the user, the smart contracts on both blockchains, and the validators. A detailed walkthrough of all transfers can be found in the documentation.\n\nAs an example, transferring native tokens for wrapped tokens, the user sends native tokens to the smart contract on blockchain A. The smart contract locks the tokens and creates a request log when the transaction is completed. Before the user can send the receive transaction to blockchain B, the validators must first check the request log. If the validators conclude the funds are correctly locked on blockchain A, they send a signature to the user, who sends the signature to the smart contract on blockchain B. The smart contract then mints the appropriate amount of wrapped tokens and sends them to the user. The wrapped token tracks the price of the original asset using oracles but is compatible with the other blockchain. This lock-and-mint process ensures a 1:1 relation between the locked and minted tokens across the two chains.\n\nSource: Documentation\n\nValidators play a defining role in Allbridge. Every bridging transaction has to be confirmed by a two-thirds majority of validators. In return, they receive their fair share of the fees when a transaction is signed successfully. To become a validator, one must meet specific technical requirements. These requirements are primarily related to the ability to set up servers and nodes. In addition, validators must stake ABR tokens. These staked funds are slashed in case a validator behaves maliciously. Slashing incentivizes validators to act in the best interest of the protocol.\n\nUnlike most bridging solutions, Allbridge uses an on-chain validator consensus. This means that every validator transaction can be tracked and verified on-chain, which improves transparency for the protocol. A dedicated block explorer will be developed to monitor transfers.\n\nSecurity\n\nAccording to PeckShield, bridges were hacked for a record high of $644 million in Q3 2021. This includes the $611 million stolen from Poly Network in what is likely the most significant theft in DeFi history - even though the funds were returned a few weeks later. In addition, the study found that $147 million, or 55% of illicit assets, were cashed out through cross-chain bridges in the first six months of 2021. Clearly, there is a lot of criminal activity in the bridge space. Therefore, the ideal blockchain bridge should not only be interconnected, high-throughput, cost-effective, and trustless but must also be very secure.\n\nThe team has expressed several measures to upgrade security, such as ordering additional security audits, implementing a kill switch, and limiting the outbound transactions. In October 2021, the audit performed by blockchain security consultant Hacken found Allbridge’s code to be well-secured.\n\nTokeneconomics\n\nThe Allbridge ecosystem is powered by the ABR and xABR tokens. The tokens are used to pay for fees and staking as follows:\n\nUsers are charged a fixed bridge fee of 0.3% for every transfer. These fees are paid in the token that is transferred. Projects must pay a monthly subscription to use the bridge. The subscription fee is paid in ABR. Of all the fees generated on the platform, 80% is swapped to ABR and distributed to stakers. The remainder is distributed to the team.\n\nStakers can lock ABR on all integrated blockchains. In return, they receive xABR tokens one-for-one, which represent their share in the blockchain staking pool. Stakers earn rewards from fees and incentivization programs. When rewards are added to the staking pool, the number of ABR in the pool increases, and xABR becomes worth more than ABR. The xABR tokens are burned in exchange for ABR when users unstake and thus receive more ABR than they initially locked. This is how stakers can generate yield on Allbridge.\n\nSource: Documentation\n\nIn addition to attractive yields, stakers also benefit from dynamic percentage fees. Users that hold xABR on a particular blockchain are charged less for transactions sent from that network. The bridge fees are reduced exponentially. This means that users can enjoy a large reduction in fees by staking only a small amount. At present, as little as 10 xABR reduces the fee from the fixed rate of 0.3% to 0.2%. The bridge fee depends on the user’s pool share and therefore changes dynamically with TVL. The minimum fee is currently set at $0.50. The fee model is designed to incentivize staking and is an important value proposition to users.\n\nA total of 100,000,000 ABR tokens were distributed to the community, APYSwap, team, staking and liquidity pools, incentive programs, and ecosystem DAO. The public sale was held on launchpads Boca Chica and Smartpad in September 2021. There are several categories of recipients for which tokens will be unlocked linearly over a multi-year period and subject to semi-annual or annual cliffs. The initial distribution and unlock schedules were as follows:\n\nSource: Documentation\n\nAre All Bridges Created Equal?\n\nMany developers have realized the opportunity for connectors in the multi-chain world. At the time of writing, there are more than 40 different bridge projects. While they all seek to make the crypto space more interoperable, they are not all created equal. Dmitriy Berenzon best categorized four types of bridges:\n\nAsset-specific: Bridges that provide access to a specific asset from a foreign chain. BTC is the most common asset to be bridged, and BitGo’s Wrapped BTC is the largest bridge of BTC to Ethereum.\nChain-specific: Bridges that connect two different networks. The most popular ones are Layer-2 bridges. For example, Avalanche Bridge allows users to transfer assets from Ethereum to Avalanche and vice versa.\nApplication-specific: Applications that provide access to two or more blockchains, but only for use within those applications. Examples include Compound Gateway and Thorchain, building separate blockchains for cross-chain lending and exchange.\nGeneralized: Protocols that are designed to transfer information across multiple blockchains. Allbridge is a generalized bridge for asset transfers. Another example is Chainlink, which bridges off-chain information across multiple networks.\n\nThrow together 100+ networks and 40+ projects across four categories, and you end up with a market that is inherently fragmented. In essence, Allbridge competes with any project that facilitates asset transfers across networks. Projects like Compound Gateway and Chainlink are therefore not considered as competitors. Note that the competitive landscape illustrated below is not fully comprehensive for the sake of simplicity.\n\nWith the rise of alternative smart contract platforms, bridges to Ethereum are imperative to increase adoption. Ethereum bridges have therefore completely exploded this year. With barely $0.7 billion TVL in April, more than $22 billion worth of assets) are now locked in the market. That’s roughly 9% of TVL in smart contract platforms. At the time of writing, there have been 83,000 unique depositors over the past 30 days, and Polygon bridges hold the largest TVL at $6.0 billion. Avalanche bridges and Axie Infinity’s Ronin Bridge come in second and third at $5.4 and $4.8 billion, respectively. As alternative blockchains become more and more popular, these numbers will only multiply in the future.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nBy now, it is clear that we are moving towards a multi-chain world. So instead of burning bridges, there is a growing need for cross-chain connectors. These bridge projects must support as many assets and networks as possible at the fastest speed and lowest cost possible. And while there is fierce competition in the market, builders must remain disciplined and implement the highest security standards to prevent malicious activity.\n\nAllbridge is working towards a single-window system. It wants to offer a universal bridge where all assets can be accessed regardless of the blockchain. This is reflected in its roadmap. Broadly, the team is focusing on four main topics:\n\nBlockchains: New networks are continuously integrated to strengthen its position as a generalized bridge. With 12 of the largest networks already supported on the platform, Allbridge aims to integrate Tezos, NEAR, Arbitrum, Optimism, and other networks next.\nDecentralization: More validators will be added at the beginning of 2022, and a DAO interface will be launched to become a truly decentralized bridge. There is no planned date for the interface yet.\nMarketing: Following its recent rebranding and UX improvements, Allbridge will launch a series of marketing campaigns and incentivization programs to attract users. The team will also establish DEX partnerships to build out its ecosystem.\nB2B products: As the user-facing bridge becomes more established, Allbridge also wants to build its B2B offering. The team plans to launch an open API in Q1 2022 and implement an interface for project subscriptions. In the future, Allbridge seeks to offer a bridge-as-a-service API solution to AMMs and other projects.\n\nThus far, Allbridge has been able to deliver on its promises. Its modular architecture has proven itself an effective way to bridge new networks. Over the last several months, the platform has offered over 132 bridge directions across 12 networks. The project is also gaining traction, with over $5 billion bridged in total. It remains to be seen whether the team can guarantee security for the protocol and head up against more established players like Multichain. If Allbridge can continue this trajectory, there appears to be an exciting road ahead for the project.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Allbridge, a member of Messari Hub.

Preliminary discussions are ongoing.\n\nSector Returns\n\nThis is the first time in four weeks that not all sectors finish with negative returns. Four of the six sectors covered ended the week with positive returns. Impressively, Smart Contract Platforms, which had the largest decline last week, has seen the highest sector return this week. It took the first place returning 7.67%, followed by the DeFi sector bringing in 4.53%. Top Assets took the last spot as it brought a return of -1.17% for the week.\n\nTop Assets\n\nTop Assets brought a diverse set of returns as the sector had four assets end the week on the green while six were in the red. Solana(SOL) was the best performer of the sector as the alternate Layer 1 broke off from the pack during the second part of the week only to give back the gains and barely end the week on the lead, returning 8.9%. Following closely was Ethereum (ETH) as it ended the week with an 8.5% return. Terra (LUNA) was the clear laggard of the group, trading far below the rest and ultimately finishing the week with a 19.1% decline.\n\nDeFi Assets\n\nAfter three weeks of precipitous decline and $20 billion in total TVL wiped out, the DeFi sector has seen some signs of stability. As hinted on the <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/weekly-recap-ending-january-20?referrer=author:guillermo-avil-s\">January 20 recap</a>, TVL broke the $220 billion critical support line and has settled on the September 2021 top of $200 billion as support. Maker (MKR) was the clear outperformer of the group ending the week with an impressive 26% return while the next best performer, Curve (CRV), was 18.3% away returning 7.7% on the week. Loopring (LRC) ended the week far below the rest of the group, returning a 19.3% loss.\n\nSmart Contract Platforms\n\nThe Smart Contract Platform sector saw the most evenly distributed range of returns as half of the assets ended the week with positive returns while the other half recorded losses. Solana (SOL) was the best performer of the week returning 8.9% closely followed by Ethereum (ETH) with 8.5%. Cosmos (ATOM) and Terra (LUNA) broke downwards from the group early on and traded closely for the rest of the week. ATOM ultimately took the last spot returning -20.5% and LUNA -19.1%.\n\nCurrencies\n\nFor most of the week it seemed as if the majority of the assets in the Currencies sector would end the week with positive returns. Only three of the ten assets ended the week with a positive performance. Zcash (ZEC) was the best performer of the group by an 11.7% margin, returning a 13.3% gain while the next best performer was DASH (DASH) at 1.6%. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) took the last spot for the week ending with a 4.5% decline.\n\nWeb3\n\nRender (RNDR) has not just been one of the best performers of the Web3 sector, but also the market. RNDR finds itself on a 34.8% gain while the rest of the market has been on a decline. RNDR is just one of the seven assets within the Web 3 sector that finished the week with positive returns while Helium (HNT), the best performer of last week, took the last spot with a 12.4% loss.\n\nGaming\n\nEight of the top ten assets by market capitalization within the Gaming sector brought positive returns for the week. The top performer was Yield Guild Games, bringing in a 15.1% return followed closely by Sandbox (SAND) with 14.1%. The rest of the group had returns ranging from 9.8% down to -2.7% with Axie Infinity (AXS) taking the last spot.\n\n",

      "title": "UXD - Tackling the Stablecoin Trilemma",
      "content": "The following report was commissioned by UXD, a member of <a href=\"https://messari.io/hub\">Messari Hub</a>. For additional information, please see the disclaimers following the article.\n\nStablecoins are one of the most important aspects in all of crypto. All major trading pairs on CEXs and DEXs alike are denominated in stablecoins. Volumes of stablecoins often exceed BTC volumes and ETH volumes. Stables are by far the most borrowed assets on decentralized money markets (27x more USDC is borrowed on Aave than ETH). Yearn’s most popular yield vaults are stablecoin vaults. Perpetual exchange protocols, which offer the most popular derivatives, are almost always collateralized against stablecoins.\n\nStablecoins are the foundation of nearly all that is DeFi.\n\nHowever, not all stablecoins are alike. Tradeoffs exist for all stablecoin implementations. Each stablecoin exists along a spectrum of decentralization, stability, and efficiency. Together, these aspects formulate the stablecoin trilemma which plagues stablecoin designs as optimization along one aspect usually leads to degradation in another. The stablecoin trilemma can be defined as:\n\nDecentralization: How dependent is the stablecoin on centralized systems?\nStability: Does the stablecoin remain at its peg without large variances, especially during times of market volatility when stable assets become high in demand?\nEfficiency: How much capital is required to secure the stablecoin? More capital required, the less efficient and vice versa.\n\nStablecoin implementations largely fall into three categories: Fiat, Collateral Debt Position (CDP), or Algorithmic (algo). Fiat stablecoins are backed by corresponding fiat dollars (or other currency) in a traditional, centralized entity. For example, USDC is issued/burned by corresponding TradFi banks who are responsible for maintaining cash and cash equivalents in custody to back issued stablecoins. Collateral Debt Position stables are issued by decentralized protocols that accept collateral and issue debt in the form of a stablecoin. Collateral backing CDP is often greater than the amount of stablecoin debt issued in order to protect the protocol from fluctuations in the collateral token price. All in all, CDP stablecoins are backed by individual user deposited collateral. Algorithmic stablecoins have the widest spectrum of implementations with various algo stablecoins having noticeably different properties. However, each algorithmic stablecoin leans on a combination of game theoretic and mechanistic systems to ensure stability of the token.\n\nSince fiat-backed stablecoins require a trusted centralized partner and collateral debt position tokens require overcollateralization due to the volatile assets accepted as collateral, algo stablecoins present the best opportunity for DeFi to solve the stablecoin trilemma with a scalable, decentralized, and efficiently scalable stablecoin. And decentralized markets are echoing this sentiment. Demand for stablecoins which can solve the trilemma and ensure long-term viability have skyrocketed over the previous year.\n\nIn Q4, the Algo stablecoin market cap grew 260%, significantly outpacing fiat and CDP-based stablecoins which expanded market caps by 18% and 87% respectively. At this pace, algo stablecoins are set to pass collateralized debt stables as the second largest category of stablecoins in Q1 2022. However, there is a significant differential between the supply of fiat stablecoins and algo stablecoins. Fiat stablecoin market capitalization is roughly 10x more than both collateral debt and algo stablecoins. This value gap is the market opportunity for algo stables as the more efficient scalability properties play out over the next year.\n\nCurrent leading algo stablecoins include UST, FRAX, and FEI. Each employs a mechanism of redemptions which alongside supply and demand forces work to keep the stablecoin price pegged. UST, for example, works by minting/burning Luna in exchange for UST so that when the UST stablecoin begins to trade over the peg, Luna can be burned and exchanged for UST at a 1:1 dollar ratio (which is at the peg, but below the current price) to be sold into the market for a small profit. Creation of more UST in this scenario pushes the UST price closer to peg via supply and demand forces. This mechanism ensures that UST always has a market for $1. Luna in this scenario absorbs the supply and demand volatility that plagues stablecoins.\n\nFrax works similarly with regards to the redemption mechanism of Luna, except FRAX is algorithmically collateralized by a floating collateral factor. Collateral factor simply defines how much USD value of collateral backs the stablecoin FRAX. At a collateral factor of 1, there is one dollar for every FRAX in reserves. As the collateral factor drops (by design in order to scale efficiently), less collateral is required per FRAX. Redemptions change by issuing FXS, the protocol’s governance token, alongside collateral (USDC) in line with the current collateral ratio. For example, with a collateral ratio of 0.75, redemptions would net $0.75 sourced from the collateral pools of the protocol and $0.25 worth of minted FXS which in total is $1 for every redeemed FRAX. Frax as a protocol also employs other mechanisms contributing to the stability of the protocol which by and large utilize collateral in market operations such as liquidity provisions, investments, or lending (these modules are referred as AMOs by Frax).\n\nWith the release of V2, FEI too deploys a redemption mechanism as the primary stability force for its algo stablecoin. Unlike FRAX, FEI is overcollateralized by its Protocol Controlled Value (PCV) reserves which consist of a variety of assets ranging from stables like DAI to volatile assets like ETH and Ethereum DeFi tokens. PCV serves both to fund 1:1 redemptions of FEI as well as to seed liquidity in trading pools guaranteeing FEI can trade at high volumes. Due to the volatile nature of the PCV collateral, FEI can shift from being overcollateralized to undercollateralized at which point redemptions would be funded with newly minted Tribe. Redemptions enable the supply of FEI to scale at a minimum 1:1 ratio relative to collateral while also enabling a stability mechanism for FEI as market volatility changes supply and demand ratios of collateral and FEI.\n\nRedemptions are the key stability mechanism utilized by current algo stables because each either has a one of or a combination of the following; volatile collateral (FEI), undercollateralized (FRAX), or requires volatility absorption mechanisms via a complementary token (UST). All because of one simple fact, none of these protocols have consistent, guaranteed backing 1:1 of collateral to stablecoins. Why don’t fiat backed stablecoins require sophisticated mechanisms of stability? Because there is faith in 1:1 backing of cash assets to each stablecoin irrespective of market volatility.\n\nSo why can’t an algorithmic stablecoin create the same guaranteed backing but without centralized cash backing?\n\nUXD Stablecoin\n\nUXD is a recently launched stablecoin protocol native to Solana. UXD aims to solve the stablecoin trilemma with a unique algorithmic design that is backed 1:1 for stable-like assets instead of relying on redemption methods to absorb volatility.\n\nEach UXD token is backed by a delta-neutral position on a perpetual derivatives exchange.\n\nWhile sounding complicated, the design is actually rather simple. Users deposit collateral such as SOL to the protocol and receive $1 of UXD in return for every $1 of SOL deposited. The SOL is then deposited to a perpetual exchange protocol (Mango Markets) as collateral and then an opposite short position is taken at the same value of the deposited SOL. So if the price of SOL falls -10%, the deposited SOL collateral would lose -10% of USD value, however, at the same time, the short position would gain +10% of USD value resulting in a net 0% move of UXD’s collateral in USD terms.\n\nHaving a net 0% move relative to the underlying asset is the definition of delta-neutral. Effectively, the UXD protocol simulates having stable assets as collateral but with volatile assets enabling it to back each UXD token 1:1 with decentralized assets.\n\nWhen a user wishes to redeem UXD for collateral, the process flows in reverse. Users burn UXD with the protocol and in return receive the exact USD amount in SOL or the collateral token of their choice. To return the user’s SOL, the protocol closes the SOL short position on the perpetual exchange for the exact dollar amount of UXD burned and the freed up SOL collateral is withdrawn to the UXD protocol at which point it is returned to the user.\n\nAs a result, the supply of UXD can scale much faster and much more efficiently than CDP stablecoins since these require more USD value of collateral than stables issued. UXD with its 1:1 stable asset backed position should more closely resemble the stability of fiat-backed stablecoins, but with the added benefit of being decentralized and censorship resistant. This same stability property is an added advantage compared to other algorithmic stables which rely on redemptions and secondary tokens to absorb volatility. Mechanisms like such are highly complex and have in the past broken peg in times of high volatility.\n\nFraming the UXD token against the stablecoin trilemma:\n\nDecentralization: UXD utilizes decentralized assets to form stable USD positions (delta-neutral) and the UXD protocol is itself designed as decentralized and its overall decentralization is dependent on the perpetual protocols it leverages.\nStability: Collateral in UXD is traditionally volatile but synthetically stabilized via derivatives, recreating the dependability of fiat backed stablecoins without reliance on centralized providers. Also, the protocol design relies on 1:1 backing guarantee with collateral assets rather than complex redemption mechanisms involving non-collateral assets (FXS and LUNA) which have only had a short history combating volatility.\nEfficiency: UXD scales at a rate of $1 UXD for every $1 deposited in collateral which is far more efficient than collateral debt position stables which require more than $1 to mint $1 in stables. While the 1:1 mechanism favors stability, it is less efficient than floating collateral factor stablecoins like FRAX which can have less than $1 in collateral for every $1 in stables. Large enough perpetual markets is the chief constraint on UXD scalability, not collateral.\n\nFor the protocol to have long term viability, a revenue source is required to align incentives and fund growth. UXD Protocol doesn’t plan to collect fees from users but rather to absorb cash flows from an integral part of perpetual exchanges - the funding rate. Funding payments on perpetual exchanges arise due to the fact traders on the exchange are trading representations of tokens, not actual tokens. Since there are no actual tokens involved, the market price on the perpetual exchange can deviate from the true market price of the underlying token being traded. To keep prices aligned, a funding payment is introduced which scales relative to the trade imbalance. If the traders on the perp exchange are overweight on the long side (which is often the case in crypto), then the funding payment would be positive where the long traders pay a percentage fee to traders holding short positions. This mechanism incentivizes traders to take the unpopular side of the trade which has the effect of pushing the perpetual exchange price back towards the true market price.\n\nSince funding historically has been positive in crypto markets, that means traders with short positions like UXD Protocol will receive funding payments from traders with long positions. However, this is not always the case and when funding turns negative, UXD Protocol requires a mechanism to pay funding payments without impacting UXD holders. To do so, an insurance fund is employed which was adequately funded ($57M) in the IDO sale of the UXP token.\n\nOverall, like many stablecoin projects, UXD aims to drive real productive use cases for the stablecoin. Productive use cases are largely centered around financial usage as opposed to speculation or a rewards vehicle. For example, debts denominated in a stablecoin drive real usage as borrowers subsequently use the stable in swaps and continue to hold the stable in regard as their debts are denominated in the token. This drives the need for deep money market pools (borrowing) and for liquid AMM pools (swaps). Less productive uses involve staking and farming which drive liquidity but ultimately are unstable, short-term masquerades of adoption. UXD’s stated roadmap is focused on driving long-term health through more productive uses of the stablecoin.\n\nUXD Tokenomics\n\nUXD protocol is governed by the UXP token. UXP was offered in a public IDO ending November 14th that raised over $57M from 3,676 investors. Funds raised in the IDO are directed towards the insurance fund which is responsible for backstopping any negative funding payments incurred on the perpetual exchanges and any protocol exploit. According to the UXD documentation, the insurance fund at its current size would be able to sustain a year’s worth of -11.4% interest on $500M of UXD. Governing the insurance fund is the responsibility of the forthcoming UXP DAO.\n\nIn addition to IDO funds, UXD raised a $3M seed round from prominent solana ecosystem investors Multicoin, Alameda Research, Defiance Capital, CMS Holdings, Solana Foundation, Mercurial Finance, Solana Founders Anatoly Yakavenko and Raj Gokal, and Saber DEX founder Dylan Macalinao.\n\nUXP holders will be the sole governing body of the UXD DAO. As such, holders are responsible for stewardship of the insurance fund and participating in governing actions. Potential governing actions could include adding new exchange integrations, adding new collateral types, protocol income management, and general improvements to the protocol.\n\nRevenue for the UXD protocol is derived from two main sources. First and foremost is the positive funding payments as a result of the short position on the perpetual exchange. Funding in crypto has historically been positive meaning UXD, over the long term, can be expected to rely on this revenue stream as the primary source of cash inflows.\n\nUXD Protocol’s second form of income is from active management of the insurance fund. Non-essential to business operations, the insurance fund is usually kept idle, only to be used during times of negative funding (shorts traders overweight longs on the perp exchange). For capital efficiency, UXD will explore asset management strategies for the insurance fund. Ultimately though it will be up to the UXP holders to dictate the management of the insurance fund.\n\nProtocol Challenges\n\nOutside of general smart contract risk, there exist a few key challenge areas for a protocol like UXD to not just work, but to scale efficiently to the size a stablecoin protocol needs.\n\nPerpetual Market Size - Currently there is roughly $30M in open interest on Solana Perpetual Exchanges ($17M on Mango across all their L1 token markets and $11M on Drift Protocol). Stablecoin marketcaps require nearly $1B in market cap to be considered successful and to be considered sufficiently liquid for widespread use. In order for UXD to reach significant levels of adoption, the amount of market activity on Solana Perpetual exchanges would need to scale significantly. At the current size of the perp markets, UXD would almost assuredly drive the funding rates negative on the exchanges since it would create an imbalance of positions to the short side. However, this would attract more traders to trade against cheaper fund borrowing rates so there is a self-referential playbook here that can scale both UXD and the perpetual markets on Solana.\n\nNegative Funding Rates - Along the same vein, when funding rates on the perpetual exchange turn negative, it’s on the UXD protocol itself to pay out. Usually, funding rates are positive in crypto due to the much larger demand to be on the long side of assets and in this case UXD protocol would be making additional money via traders paying it funding. However, if UXD scales faster than OI on the exchanges, there exists a real possibility funding could get driven negative and the protocol would be paying. To counteract this probability, sufficient funds are stored in the insurance fund to cover negative funding periods (which have historically not been long in duration). In the unlikely event that the insurance fund is depleted paying funding payments, additional UXP would be auctioned off to replenish the insurance fund. Even in this unlikely event, the insurance fund would not rapidly be depleted via funding payments (no flash crashes, just fairly predictable payments over known periods of time) so UXD holders would nearly always be able to redeem for collateral.\n\nExchange Exit Liquidity - Related to exchange sizes, there needs to exist enough counterside liquidity for UXD to unwind its short positions. UXD by design puts on short positions every time a user deposits collateral into the protocol, but when the UXD holder wishes to exchange the stablecoin for their collateral, the short position needs to be unwound and the collateral returned. For this to happen, there needs to be liquidity (users or market makers) on the exchange willing to sell tokens to UXD protocol in the size required. This risk is more prevalent in times of market volatility.\n\nTreasury Management - UXD as a protocol is designed not to make money from UXD users but in the way it manages its collateral (positive funding rates) and its insurance fund. As the insurance fund is deployed in asset management strategies, the benefit is clearly the capital appreciation of the fund size. However, on the flip side there is introduced risk that funds are subjected to which needs to be taken into account. Not a great concern as presumably the fund will be deployed in low-risk strategies with the only notable risk being smart contract risk.\n\nUXD Supply and Demand - Every stablecoin is subject to fluctuations in demand which can drive prices off peg. What matters is the ability of the protocol to absorb price volatility via redemption mechanisms to remain at peg or user confidence in the future redemption abilities (fiat stablecoins). UXD offers both avenues but as a growing stablecoin, it’s still subjected to the risk - especially in its early stages when concentrated amounts of UXD can experience more volatility pressure than if the supply of UXD was vast.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nUXD offers a unique solution to the stablecoin landscape. As Solana continues to build out its DeFi ecosystem, having truly decentralized, native stablecoins will greatly benefit the ecosystem as a whole. Market demand for this type of solution is rapidly increasing, not just on Solana, but across DeFi as projects and users alike look for stable assets without centralization risk and that synergistically benefit the ecosystem. UXD has the potential to propel Solana’s already thriving derivatives market into new territory by catalyzing the cost of trading down and providing sufficient stable liquidity.\n\nThis report was commissioned by UXD, a member of Messari Hub.
